 * Skin feels comfortably hydrated after each use

2641,"NIOD Photography Fluid, Tan, Opacity 8% - 30ml","NIOD PHOTOGRAPHY FLUID, TAN, OPACITY 8% - 30ML

This serum-textured surface treatment complements the approach of NIOD's
Photography Fluid, Opacity 12% by balancing light absorption effects (in
contrast to light reflection focus of PF 12%) with selective reflectiveness of
darker interference pigments. Like PF 12%, this effort is supported by
perfecting prisms and topical photo-finishing technologies to offer radiance in
life and specifically through the camera lens. 



HD SUSPENSION TECHNOLOGY

 * Bio-derivatives of Iceland moss and adaptive esters form a superb matrix for
   suspension and spreading of very fine high-definition interference pigments
   that would otherwise feel powdery. This unique matrix offers incredible skin
   compatibility, spreadability and even distribution of hues.

 

CHROMATIC RADIANCE TECHNOLOGIES

 * Nano-Prismatic Bronze TechnologyAn ultra-fine interference pigment, this mesh
   bronze suspension (in contrast to fluid coverage pigments) blends into skin
   tone for a natural bronzed hue to highlight the base caramel tone of the
   formulation when applied on the skin.

 * Nano-Prismatic Gold TechnologyDisappears immediately upon application with a
   natural golden hue as a foundation to healthy-looking, radiant skin.

 

HUE TECHNOLOGIES

 * Caramel SaccharidesThe natural tan tone of the formulation is entirely from
   natural caramel which is dissolved in sea polysaccharides that completely
   prevent drying and unevenness common with caramel application on the skin.

 * Nano-Prismatic Yellow-Red Camera Hue CorrectorSixth-generation, ultra-fine
   hue corrector blacks out red tones and minimizes undesirable yellow ones for
   skin that looks instantly better in life and on camera.

 

SUPPORT TECHNOLOGIES

 * Hydrophilic Polymer SystemA suspension of perfectly-spherical hydrophilic
   polymers offers colour stability and light refraction to minimize visible
   skin imperfections that colour formulations generally highlight further
   (which is why makeup often makes the skin look older).

 * Filmogenic PolymersA studied suspension of long-chain filmogenic polymers
   prevents evaporation and offers visible evenness, consistency and hydration
   throughout the day.
   
   Usage Note: PF 8% can be used on its own to add natural golden tan radiance
   to any skin tone. It can be used alongside PF 12% to create a natural and
   blended contouring effect (with PF 12% used above the cheekbones and PF 8%
   used below). PF 8% can also be used alongside traditional colour
   formulations.

 

DIRECTIONS:

Apply instead of liquid foundation for natural-looking radiance with a hint of
translucent tan. This formula can also be used under, over or mixed with liquid
foundation if coverage is desired. Can be used alongside PF, Opacity 12% to
create a semi-translucent contouring effect.

A weightless tone perfecting elixir.

Developed to rid the complexion of imperfections such as redness and
inflammation, the Non-Acid Acid Precursor 15% is ideal for those who suffer with
visible imperfections. Utilising a cocktail of soothing yet exfoliating
ingredients the innovative formula induces incomparable radiance and surface
regularity so you can feel proud of the skin you're in.

NAAP is a non-acidic alternative to acid-based epidermal resurfacing. Instead of
using direct acids like AHA/BHA or retinoids that are common in skincare, NAAP
uses fermentation bio-derivatives and amino isolates that act as precursors to
skin-compatible acids, encouraging visible radiance and visible surface
regularity without the redness and inflammation associated with acids. NAAP was
found non-irritating in an independent Human Repeat Insult Patch Test. 



TECHNOLOGIES

A suspension of probiotic bacteria purified through lysis acts as a precursor of
skin-compatible natural acids. 
Two forms of amino isolates mimic the visible surface-regularizing action of
retinoids without any presence of retinoids or related acids. 
A bio-ferment oligopeptide offers better exfoliation than alpha hydroxyl acids
without irritation or inflammation. 
A highly-purified natural levomenol offers surface barrier support, hydration
and comfort. 
A marine-derived exopolysaccharide increases water-retention capacity—essential
with enhanced skin turnover.


 

DIRECTIONS:

Apply a few drops at bedtime to the face avoiding the immediate eye areas. If
used as part of a NIOD regimen, apply after CAIS and MMHC but before HV. If used

3128,The Ordinary Mineral UV Filters SPF 15 with Antioxidants - 50ml,"Overview:

The Mineral UV Filter formulas avoid the use of any nanoparticles. Instead, a
refined dispersion of micronized ZnO and TiO2 in flexible, high-volatility,
non-comedogenic silicones allows the formulations to remain extremely
lightweight by optimizing the amount of the blocking agents. Our formulation
uses mainly ZnO for its protective effects (because in addition to
reflecting/refracting light, ZnO is actually also able to absorb UV rays without
creating oxygen radicals) and the supporting TiO2 that it contains is only in
rutile form (no anatase form of TiO2 is used at all since it's an aggressive
producer of free radicals).
The technologies shared in Mineral UV Filter Formulas’ are:
Bio-Active Antioxidant Network
A potent combination that scavenges and neutralizes free radicals, minimizes the
intensity of UV radiation penetrating the skin, visibly protects biological
membranes and supports the skin response to UV exposure. 
Bio-Sugar Complex
A unique blend of hygroscopic molecules with Multi-layer coverage providing both
short and long-term hydration and also naturally increases skin’s own capacity
to hold water.
Skin Identical Lipids
Lipids that visibly restore the compromised barrier and prevents transepidermal
water loss (TEWL).
Tasmanian Pepperberry
Rich in flavanones, anthocyanins, and minerals, this active technology helps to
calm stressed skin, acting almost immediately.

DIRECTIONS

Apply to face liberally and evenly 15 to 20 minutes before UV exposure. If
continued UV exposure is expected, to maintain protection, reapply at least
every 2 hours or after material water exposure, towel-drying, swimming or
extensive perspiration. Suitable for all skin tones. For children under 6 months
of age, consult a doctor prior to use. Use a water-resistant sunscreen if
swimming or sweating. For external use only. Do not use on damaged or broken
skin. When using this product keep out of eyes. Rinse with water to remove. Stop
use and ask a doctor if rash occurs.

3346,The Ordinary 100% Organic Virgin Sea-Buckthorn Fruit Oil - 30ml,"Who is it for?

All skin types

Introduction

Sustainably-sourced, organic 100% pure Sea-Buckthorn Fruit oil, unrefined and
virgin in origin.

 * This oil contains a high concentration of rare palmitoleic acid (Omega 7) for
   nourishing & protecting the skin
 * With additional fatty acids like palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid,
   linolenic acid and linoleic acid
 * With antioxidants tocopherol (Vitamin E), carotenoids and lycopene that all
   help to protect the skin from free radical damage and to maintain the skin’s
   normal barrier function
 * Derived from the pulp of the Sea-Buckthorn berry

How to use:

 * Mix a few drops with other treatments in the palm of your hand and apply to
   the face, ideally at bedtime, after application of water-based treatments
 * Wash hands after application and avoid product contact with fabric as it may
   stain

BeautyFeatures Style Guide:

 * Completely unrefined, this product has a natural scent due to its high
   palmitoleic acid (Omega-7) content. This scent is not an indication of
   rancidity. Sea-Buckthorn Fruit oil that does not have scent is likely to have
   been highly refined and, therefore, would contain less active compounds and
   would likely offer impaired benefits.
 * The formula's intense natural orange-red hue is due to its high carotenoids
   and lycopene content. After application, the colour of this oil will remain
   on your skin until it is washed off. Please use a very small amount or dilute
   with other products for easier application.
