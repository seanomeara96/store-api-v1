82,Ovulation Tests - 10 Tests,"OVULATION TESTS – 10 TESTS

Detect your ovulation and enhance your ability to conceive with the Ovulation
Test Strips. Designed to detect your LH (luteinising hormone) surge, which
highlights your fertility window (at your most fertile) and confirms ovulation.
Ideal for those who use volumes of tests as they are available at a fraction of
the cost of most chemist branded products and deliver an accuracy as precise as
the leading market brands. With each test strip boasting 20mIu LH sensitivity,
the Ovulation Test Strips are easy to use by simply dipping the strip into the
urine and one of two results will appear. A reading of one line will indicate
that you are not currently ovulating whereas a two line reading suggests that it
is the optimum time in which to have intercourse and increase your chances of
conception.

How Do the Ovulation Tests Strips Work?

The Ovulation Test strip detects the presence of the key fertility hormone LH
(luteinising hormone) which is present in urine and increases significantly
during the middle of the menstrual cycle. The surge in LH triggers ovulation
which is when the ovary releases an egg, ready for insemination. Typically
ovulation will occur approximately 24-48 hours following a positive reading.

Directions for use:

 * Ensure both the test strip and urine are at room temperature before testing.

 * Remove test strip from the foil packaging and dip the strip into the urine
   with the arrow pointing downawards towards the urine.

 * Remove the test strip after 3 seconds and let the strip lie flat on a clean,
   dry, non-absorbent surface.

 * The test will read invalid if the urine goes above the Max line as indicated
   on the test strip.

 * Please ensure that you read the results in 5 minutes as results are invalid
   after this time.

 * Do not use the first morning urine with this test as LH is synthesised early
   in the morning and won’t show up in your urine until later in the day. The
   optimal time for urine collection is between 10.00am – 8.00pm.

 * Reduce your liquid intake about 2 hours before collecting the urine as
   diluted urine can disort the test from detecting the LH surge correctly.",https://www.fertilitystore.ie/ovulation-tests-10-tests/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-c7kc4/products/82/images/266/test_embarazo_ovulacion_6__24111.1427111048.386.513.jpg?c=2,6.99,EUR,6942468131046,40977,Core Tests,,6942468131046,6942468131046,,,

85,Fertilcheck Fertility Test for Couples,"FERTILCHECK FERTILITY TEST FOR COUPLES

 

The babystart¨ FertilTests fertility screening test for both men and women,
measures sperm count in men and the sex hormone FSH in women. This is a
combination twin test pack for couples to share in the privacy of their own
home. For the women there is the babystart¨ FertilCheck Female Fertility
screening test for women which measures the sex hormone that is an indicator of
a their biological fertility clock.

A woman’s fertility starts to decline after she gets to 30 and the decline
gradually accelerates until she gets to menopause. This reduction in fertility
is reflected in a similar gradual increase in the the hormone FSH (follicle
stimulating hormone). Rising levels of FSH tend to be associated with reduced
fertility. The FSH hormone can also be raised in women with irregular periods
and without doubt will steadily rise as a woman gets older. As menopause
approaches the levels get particularly high and act as an early warning system
for peri-menopause. The babystart¨ FertilCheck Female Fertility home diagnostic
screening test is a rapid test of FSH concentration in urine. The kit contains
two ECOstripª Female Fertility tests and if both test results are positive it is
an indicator of reduced fertility. The test is greater than 99% accurate. With
this test a negative result is going to be good news although its not proof of
fertility. A positive test result suggests that fertility is reduced and we
recommend that a woman see her doctor to discuss the results and perhaps have
more tests done.

For the man the babystart¨ FertilCount Male Fertility test is a rapid diagnostic
test of sperm concentration in semen. Sperm count is widely recognised as the
major indicator of the fertility in men. There is a one test kit and a two test
kit. The World Health Organisation has defined a man’s fertility on the basis of
the concentration of sperm in semen with the cut off point being set at 15
million sperm per mL of sperm. The babystart¨ FertilCount Male Fertility test
kits are a unique home test that will tell you if a man’s sperm concentration is
greater or less than the WHO cut off point. A positive result is going to be
good news although its not proof of fertility. A negative result suggests then
man should see his doctor, which is not all bad news, because it does at least
save the a couple months of futile trying for a baby.

The babystart¨ FertilCheck Female Fertility test kit and the babystart¨
FertilCount Male Fertility test kit will allow a couple planning a pregnancy to
test their fertility potential, privately and discreetly in their own home.

More than just a basal thermometer, this FDA cleared fertility monitor is clever
enough to calculate your precise date of ovulation and your peak fertility days
based on your daily temperatures and other fertility indicators. The Ibasal is a
computerised digital basal thermometer and fertility monitor in one that
enhances your chances of conception by accurately measuring your BBT and
interpreting this data to produce a fertility prediction in advance of your
ovulation. Easy to use and featuring an accuracy of 1/100th of a degree, the

fall pregnant.The Ibasal is ideal for women who experience irregular cycles as
well as regular ones, as it continues to learn your body’s own unique patterns
month after month in order to deliver accurate results.

What is Basal Body Temperature?

Your basal body temperature (BBT) is the lowest body temperature recorded in any
24 hour period. To ensure an accurate reading, you need to take your temperature
as you first wake in the morning (even before sitting up in bed). In order to do
this successfully you need a specific basal thermometer which has sensitivity
enough to measure the most minute changes in body temperature. When using the
BBT method try to wake and take your reading at precisely the same time each
morning.

Basal Body Temperature & Ovulation

Basal body temperature (BBT) charting is a tried and true method for determining
when during your menstrual cycle you will ovulate. Prior to ovulation your basal
body temperature will range between 97.2 to about 97.7 degrees Fahrenheit.
However two to three days post ovulation, hormonal changes will cause a
fluctuation of about 0.4 to 1.0 degree in your BBT which is maintained at that
level until your next period. If you conceive your temperature will stay
elevated throughout the pregnancy. Charting your BBT on a month to month basis
you will be able to determine whether there is a pattern to your cycle, which
will assist you in predicting ovulation the next time around.",https://www.fertilitystore.ie/ibasal-digital-thermometer/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-c7kc4/products/120/images/298/ibasal_digital_thermometer_1__51873.1427111085.386.513.jpg?c=2,69.99,EUR,895749000394,43486,Fairhaven,,895749000394,895749000394,,,

including zinc which contributes to normal fertility and reproduction. Zinc and
vitamin C also contribute to the protection of cells from oxidative stress, an
important consideration for healthy sperm production as sperm can be damaged by
free radicals. These nutrients also help contribute to the normal function of
the immune system.

Zinc is arguably one of the most important minerals for the male reproductive
system as semen contains 100 times more zinc than is found in the blood. In fact
each ejaculate contains around 5mg of zinc; one half of the whole recommended
daily nutrient intake, therefore 15mg of zinc has been included within the
formulation.

Conception and Spermatogenesis

Vitamin B6 contributes to the regulation of hormonal activity, while zinc
contributes to the maintenance of normal testosterone levels in the blood and
selenium contributes to normal spermatogenesis. Folate, iron, magnesium and
vitamin B12 have a role in cell division, plus vitamin A, which has a role in
the process of cell specialisation.",https://www.fertilitystore.ie/wellman-conception-30-tablets/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-c7kc4/products/123/images/401/wellman-conception__77055.1500643965.386.513.jpg?c=2,13.99,EUR,5021265223534,40366,Vitabiotics,,5021265223534,5021265223534,,,

130,Female Fertility Test: Babystart,"FEMALE FERTILITY TEST: BABYSTART

Track your fertility with the the FertilCheck Female Fertility Test from
Babystart. A home diagnostic screening test that rapidly assesses your levels of
FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) present in your urine. As a woman ages, her
fertility naturally declines and after the age of 40 declines quite
significantly until she reaches menopausal age, this decline in fertility is
matched by an increase in the FSH hormone (follicle stimulating hormone).
Increased levels of FSH are associated with reduced fertility, however the FSH
hormone can also be raised in women with irregular periods, though as menopause
approaches the levels rise dramatically and act as an indicator for the
beginning of the peri-menopause. With a 99% accuracy the test kit contains two
ECOstrip Female Fertility Tests and if both tests result in a positive it is
indicated that you have a reduced fertility.

Why Take a FSH Test?

 * Assist in finding the cause of infertility, FSH testing is commonly used to
   evaluate a woman’s egg supply (ovarian reserve).

 * Evaluate a man’s low sperm count.

 * To help alleviate and evaluate menstrual problems, such as irregular or
   absent periods. This can assist in determining whether a woman is going
   through or has gone through the menopause.

 * Can help diagnose and idenitfy certain pituitary gland disorders such as a
   tumour.

Reading the Result:

If the test shows a negative result this is good news, however it is not proof
of fertility. A positive result indicates that fertility is compromised and we
recommend that a woman with a positive results see her doctor to discuss her
results and undergo further evaluation if needed.

What Do the Results Mean?

Low: Both your estrogen and luteinising hormone levels are low. You are unlikely

High: Once the monitor detects a rise in the level of estrogen it will display
‘high’. On subsequent days the monitor will look for your LH surge. The monitor
will continue to display ‘high’ until the LH surge is detected and then the word
‘peak’ is displayed.

Peak: Once your LH surge is detected the monitor will display ‘peak’. This will
be displayed for 2 days – you are at your most fertile the day of the LH surge
and the day after (normally the day of ovulation).

Pregnant: If you have used the test to detect and confirm a pregnanct the result
will be displayed. The monitor is 99% accurate at detecting pregnancy from the
day your period is due.

140,Digital Basal Thermometer For Fertility Charting,"DIGITAL BASAL THERMOMETER FOR FERTILITY CHARTING

Chart your fertility naturally with the Digital Basal Thermometer from Fairhaven
Health. Designed specifically for fertility charting the Digital Basal
Thermometer allows a woman to determine her body temperature or in fertility
speak her BBT (basal body temperature). The Digital Basal Thermometer will
detect in the two to three days post ovulation a subtle rise in your basal body
temperature, this will enable you to chart and predict ovulation on a monthly
basis and determine the most likely time (fertility window) in which to have
intercourse if trying for a baby. The Fairhaven Digital Basal Thermometer
provides temperature readings to 1/100th of a degree Fahrenheit – ideal for
fertility charting. As this method of prediction depends of consistency and
accuracy the thermometer also features charting functions, such as digital
memory recall and a peak temperature indicator.

What is Basal Body Temperature?

Your basal body temperature (BBT) is the lowest body temperature recorded in a
24 hour period. To ensure an accurate reading, you need to take your temperature
as you first wake in the morning (even before sitting up in bed). In order to do
this successfully you need a specific basal thermometer which has sensitivity
enough to measure the most minute changes in body temperature. When using the
BBT method try to wake and take your reading at precisely the same time each
morning.

Basal Body Temperature & Ovulation

Prior to ovulation your basal body temperature will range between 97.2 to about
97.7 degrees Fahrenheit. However two to three days post ovulation, hormonal
changes will cause a fluctuation of about 0.4 to 1.0 degree in your BBT which is
maintained at that level until your next period. If you conceive your
temperature will stay elevated throughout the pregnancy. Charting your BBT on a
month to month basis you will be able to determine whether there is a pattern to
your cycle, which will assist you in predicting ovulation the next time around.
Basal body temperature (BBT) charting is a tried and true method for determining
when during your menstrual cycle you will ovulate

An egg can only live for 24 hours or less after it is released, while sperm
survives only a few days in your body. Using our Midstream Ovulation Test helps
you predict the two most fertile days following a surge in the luteinizing
hormone (hLH) which usually comes before ovulation. Having intercourse within
these days will maximize your chances of becoming pregnant.

Each ovulation test is individually sealed in a foil pouch. 

When to start testing:

First, determine the average length of your mentrual cycle. The length of
menstrual cycle is the number of days from the first day of menstrual bleeding
to the day before bleeding begins on the next period. Determine the usual length
of the menstrual cycle over the lastfew months. Then refer to the Cycle Chart to
determine on which day of the menstrual cycle to begin testing.

Positive for L.H. surge

If two colour bands are visible and the test band is of equal or greater colour
intensity (darker) than the control band, this is a positive result and a good
indication that the L.H. surge is occurring. You should ovulate within the next
24-36 hours. Sexual intercourse on the evening of the first positive test is
advised.

Negative for L.H. surge

If two bands are visible but the test band is of a less intense colour (paler)
than the control band or cannot be seen, this means the L.H. level is at or near
its normal level and that the surge is not in progress. You should continue with
daily testing.

Invalid result

If no control band appears within 5 minutes, the result is invalid and should be
ignored. A visible control line is needed in all cases to confirm a proper test
result.

LH Ovulation Test (10 Tests)

The Core Test Ovulation Test strip is most economical way to test for ovulation.
The test strip will detect your LH (Luteinizing Hormone) Surge which is when you
are most fertile.

 
How to do the test
 * The test strip and urine have to be at room temperature for testing.
 * Remove the test strip from the sealed pouch.
 * Immerse the strip into urine with the arrow pointing towards the urine.
 * Take the strip out after three seconds and lay the strip flat on a clean,
   dry, non absorbent surface.
 * Important: do not allow the urine level to exceed the Max line; otherwise the
   test will not perform correctly.
 * Read results in five minutes. Do not read results after five minutes.

 
 
HCG Pregnancy Test (10 Tests)
 
This Pregnancy Test has been specifically designed for couples trying for a baby
who tend to use a high volume of pregnancy tests and don’t want to spend a
fortune on single top brand tests but want the same high quality and accuracy.
 
How Does The Test Work?
 * The test strip and urine have to be at room temperature (15-30)

 
When to collect urine for the test ?
 * Any urine specimen is appropriate for Pregnancy Testing but the first morning
   urine specimen is optimal because of its highest concentration of HCG.

 

Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the
developing placenta shortly after fertilization. In normal pregnancy, HCG can be
detected in serum as early as 7 days following conception. The concentration of
HCG continues to rise rapidly, frequently exceeding 100 mIU/mL by the first
missed menstrual period and peaking in the 100,000-200,000 mIU/mL range by 10-12
weeks into pregnancy. 

The appearance of HCG soon after conception and its subsequent rise
in concentration during early gestational growth make it an excellent marker for
the early detection of pregnancy. ",https://www.fertilitystore.ie/fertility-preseed-bundle-50-off/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-c7kc4/products/155/images/422/fertility_bundle__88910.1459267466.220.290__52852.1513601779.386.513.jpg?c=2,29.99,EUR,1,100918,,,1,1,,,

The first male fertility test kit to attain CE Mark status for the latest
fertile cut-off standard of 15 million sperm per ml of sperm, established by the
World Health Organisation. The Babystart FertilCount male fertility test is a
rapid diagnostic test of sperm concentration in semen. Sperm count is widely
recognised as the major indicator of the fertility in men.

The World Health Organisation has defined a man's fertility on the basis of the
concentration of sperm in semen, with the cut-off point being set at 15 million
sperm per ml of semen. The Babystart FertilCount male fertility test kit is a
unique home test that will tell you if a man's sperm concentration is greater or
less than the new World Health Organisation cut-off point. A positive result is
a promising indicator, although is not proof of fertility.

This Babystart FertilCount male fertility test kit will allow a man to test his
fertility potential privately and discreetly in his own home. The test cassette
works by staining the sperm cells (DNA) in a semen sample to produce a blue
colour. The more sperm cells that are stained in the sample, the darker the
'test well' becomes. Clinical trials have rated the Babystart FertilCount male
fertility test to have a 97% accuracy in identifying whether a sample is above
or below the WHO cut-off point for fertility.

 * An easy to use screening test designed to help measure sperm concentration

Vitamins, minerals and amino acids for mother and baby...

With babystart FertilCare no longer is there need to purchase complicated and
expensive combinations of vitamins and minerals - just 1 tablet a day provides
safe levels of essential nutrients for conception and beyond. FertilCare has
been formulated to provide a single unique nutritional supplement for use by
women when planning a pregnancy. The ingredients have been carefully selected
and are used in moderate safe levels according to EU standards. The formulation
contains no herbals, only pure scientifically proven compounds with known
effects giving FertilCare a high “quality” status. Only those ingredients known
to especially benefit fertility, conception and pregnancy are included. It has
also been carefully formulated to help safeguard dietary requirements as soon as
you start trying to conceive and contains essential vitamins, minerals and
nutrients such folic acid, zinc, vitamin B6 and particularly vitamin B12, iron,
magnesium and vitamin D3 which contribute to normal cell division and neural
tube development early in pregnancy. FertilCare should then continue to be taken
during pregnancy as research has shown that even with a good diet, extra
nutrients may be required throughout the whole pregnancy.


Reproductive Health
Nutritional therapies and antioxidants that have proven beneficial in helping
support reproductive health in women include zinc which contributes to normal
fertility and reproduction and vitamin B6 which contributes to the regulation of
hormonal activity. The FertilCare formula also includes vitamin B12, iron,
magnesium and vitamin D, which contribute to normal cell division in early
pregnancy.


Nutritional support
FertilCare provides all round support with additional nutrients including biotin
& copper which contribute to normal energy release and iron which contributes to
the normal function of the immune system and formation of red blood cells and
hemoglobin. Vitamins B6 and B12 are also important to help maintain the normal
functioning of the nervous system. The FertilCare formula also includes
Beta-carotene and L-Arginine, which helps to stimulate the reproductive organs
in women by improving circulation. A lot of interest has been created by recent
research suggesting that L-Arginine can improve female libido. This could be
useful for the pre-conceptual couple.

sperm quality. Sperm quality relates to motility, count/concentration,
morphology and volume.

babystart® FertilManplus™should be taken by men that have a known sperm quality
problem or in support when, as a couple, a pregnancy is not occurring.

The formulation contains no herbals, only pure scientifically proven compounds,
with known effects, giving babystart® FertilManplus™ a high “quality” status.

Studies show that L-Carnitine and anti-oxidant supplementation, Glutathione in
particular, can improve sperm quality, and possibly increase the chances of
conception. There is strong clinical evidence to show that men diagnosed with
infertility have high levels of oxidative stress that may impair the quality of
their sperm. Previous evidence has also shown that oxidative stress can decrease
a sperm's life span, its motility, and its ability to penetrate the oocyst, or
egg cell.

Nutritional therapies and antioxidants that have proven beneficial in treating
male infertility and improving sperm counts, sperm morphology and motility
include:

L-Carnitine, L-Arginine, Zinc, Selenium, Vitamin A, B Vitamins, Vitamin C,
Vitamin E, Glutathione, Coenzyme Q10 and Folic Acid, ALL of these are included
in the formulation of the babystart® FertilManplus™ sperm supplement.

about their chances of making a woman pregnant. SwimCount works by measuring the
ability of sperm cells to swim, which is a key factor in achieving pregnancy.

 * SwimCount measures the concentration of sperm that can swim (known as motile
   sperm).
 * Results in just 30 minutes or below the WHO threshold for normal
 * 96% accuracy when comparing the results to microscopy. 

Poor sperm quality is a key factor behind the problems many couples experience
when trying to conceive. Since it can be inconvenient and embarrassing to visit
a hospital or fertility clinic to get tested, many men choose to buy at-home
sperm tests. However, the existing home tests do not accurately assess male
fertility since they only measure sperm count and not sperm quality. SwimCount
is the first home test, which allows men to get a reliable answer about their
chances of making a woman pregnant. SwimCount works by measuring the ability of
sperm cells to swim, which is a key factor in achieving pregnancy.

Why choose SwimCount?

Thanks to patented technology, SwimCount is a reliable easy-to-use home test kit
for men that measures sperm quality - and all in the privacy of your own home!
SwimCount measures the concentration of sperm in your ejaculate that can swim
(known as motile sperm).

How to use?

 * Simply add the sperm sample to the device and within 30 minutes the color
   indicates whether the motile sperm quantity is above or below the WHO
   threshold for normal.
 * SwimCount provides 96% accuracy when comparing the results to microscopy.
 * If the test shows your motile sperm concentration is below the cut-off level
   for normal sperm quality, you should consult your doctor for further
   fertility testing

ONE IN FIVE HEALTHY YOUNG MEN HAS AN ABNORMAL SPERM QUALITY.

40% of conception issues are due to male fertility issues. Poor sperm quality is
a key factor in why many couples experience problems when trying to conceive. It
can be inconvenient and embarassing to visit a hospital or fertility clinic to
get tested so many men choose in-home sperm tests. However, until now, all
that’s been available are tests that measure sperm count only, not sperm
quality.

SwimCount is the first home test which allows you to get a reliable answer on
your chance of conceiving by measuring sperm cells' ability to swim – a key
factor in achieving pregnancy. 

Our goal has never been to replace a full evaluation that has to be performed
by fertility professionals so any abnormal result will have to be further
analysed by a professional. But, SwimCount can enable you to get an easy and

182,FERTI LILY Conception Cup,"The Ferti Lily Conception Cup is an innovative, hormone-free, affordable
conception aid that will help increase your chances of getting pregnant
faster. Inserted into the vagina after ejaculation, the Ferti Lily pushes semen
towards the cervix (the opening of the uterus), cradling the sperm in the
protective environment of the cervical mucus. This way, more sperm cells survive
and more of them can swim up into the uterus. And the more sperm cells enter the
uterus, the higher the chances that one of them will reach and penetrate the egg
- thus increasing the odds of conception.

Features:

 * Helpful when trying conceive at home
 * Designed to deliver as much sperm as possible directly to the cervix
 * Re-usable for up to 6 cycles
 * Soft, flexible, 100% Medical grade silicone
 * Manufactured in Switzerland
 * Hormone-Free
 * Easy to use and comfortable to wear
 * The Ferti Lily Cup can remain in place for up to 1 hour

FAQ’s on Ferti.Lily

What is the FERTI.LILY Conception Cup?

The FERTI·LILY is a hormone-free conception cup that can be used from the
comfort of your home to help increase the chances of conceiving. Made from soft
silicone, it can be comfortably inserted after sex and is designed to push the
sperm towards the cervix. The more sperm that reach the cervical mucus, where
they are protected, the more of them survive for longer, increasing the chances
of more sperm cells swimming into the uterus towards the egg. In turn, this
gives you a better chance of getting pregnant.

How can the FERTI.LILY help me to conceive?

By placing the sperm cells closer to the cervix after intercourse, conception
cups can increase the amount of sperm cells that reach the cervix, decrease the
distance sperm cells have to swim to enter the cervix, and protect the sperm
from the hostile pH of the vagina. Studies have shown that using a cervical cup
after intercourse can increase the amount of sperm cells that swim into the
cervical mucus by more than 300%. Conception cups have been used by
gynecologists and specialists since the 1950’s to help increase the chances of
success with donor sperm. The conception cup has now been redesigned by
FERTI·LILY so that couples can use them from the comfort of their home to
increase their chances of conception.

How do I insert the FERTI.LILY?

Have sex with your partner (without using any contraception). After he has
ejaculated inside you, you can insert the cup by turning it inside out to look
like an umbrella. With one finger inside the upturned cup, gently push it into
your vagina until it reaches the top (your cervix). Once it is in place, gently
tug the stem to pop the cup back the right way round. The cup acts as a cradle
for the sperm, keeping it in place, leaving you free to do whatever you want. No
need to lie with your legs in the air: you can get up and walk around, go to the
toilet, take a shower, or simply drift off to sleep. After 20-60 minutes, you
can remove and wash the cup.

After intercourse the vagina is generally well lubricated and also larger than
normal, so usually it is not uncomfortable to insert or remove the FERTI·LILY.
If you are having trouble inserting or removing the cup it helps to fold it up
like a menstrual cup when you are inserting it. Once it is past the entrance it
will open up and you can push it towards the cervix. Similarly, when you remove
it you can use your fingers to fold the cup while it’s still inside to make it
smaller for removal.

How long can I use the FERTI.LILY?

The FERTI·LILY Conception Cup can be re-used for up to six cycles, on the basis
that you use the cup roughly three times per cycle (so up to 18 times). Any
longer than this and the silicone may deteriorate, so replace the cup when you
have completed your sixth cycle. Should you notice any signs of deterioration or
damage to the silicone at any point, such as a tear, unusual odour, or
discolouring, discard the cup and replace it. A cup in poor condition can cause
irritation, break or may harm sperm.

Can I sleep with the FERTI.LILY in?

We do not recommend sleeping with the cup still in. While the silicone is very
safe, the cup is not intended or indicated to keep in overnight. 

In our data we see that the biggest effect of sperm cells swimming into the
cervical mucus takes place within 20 minutes and after an hour there is not much
benefit in keeping the cup in place. t.

Can I have sex with the cup inside?

Whilst it is technically possible to have sex whilst wearing the cup, you may
accidentally dislodge the cup and you will probably find the stem gets in the
way. However, you can still enjoy non-penetrative sex. In fact, having an orgasm
can actually help you conceive, so if you’ve inserted the cup already but
haven’t yet had an orgasm, it’s a good idea to try.

Do I have to remove the FERT.LILY to go to the toilet?

No. You can still urinate or have a bowel movement with the FERTI·LILY Cup
inside you.

Does silicone do anything to your body or hormones?

No. The FERTI·LILY Conception Cup is made from medical grade silicone, which is
completely inert. It will not release any chemicals or hormones into your body.

How do I care for the FERTI.LILY?

The FERTI·LILY Conception Cup should be washed between each use according to the
cleaning instructions provided in the box. Before first use, boil the cup in tap
water of drinking quality or bottled mineral water. Do not add soap or detergent
to the boiling water, as it may break down the silicone. A FERTI·LILY Conception
Cup that is well looked after can be re-used for up to six cycles.

Why is there still liquid in the cup when it is emptied?

The cup is almost always filled with fluid afterwards. That is a collection of
the plasma (the liquid in the ejaculate that contains the sperm) as well as
cervical mucus. A lot of the sperm will have had the time to swim into the
cervix, but there will always be liquid left behind. The good news is that if
the cup is filled afterwards, you will be sure that you actually pushed the
sperm to the cervix.
