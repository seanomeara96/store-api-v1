2383,Pregnacare Conception - His & Hers 60 Tablets,"Pregnacare® His & Her Conception now provides the opportunity for couples to
take a convenient, balanced daily formula specifically developed with nutrients
for male and female reproductive health as well as overall wellbeing. The extra
value dual pack contains both Pregnacare® Conception and Wellman® Conception
nutritional tablets, which have been specifically designed to support both men
and women who are trying for a baby.

Pregnacare® Conception Tablets For Women

Introducing Pregnacare® Conception

Pregnacare® Conception provides a carefully balanced comprehensive formulation
of micronutrients including inositol, l-arginine, n-acetyl cysteine and
selenium. The formula also includes vitamin B12 and D plus folic acid at 400mcg.

Recommended Folic Acid level

Pregnacare® Conception provides 400mcg folic acid, the exact level recommended
by the UK Department of Health for all women who are trying to
conceive.Supplemental folic acid intake increases maternal folate status*. Low
maternal folate status is a risk factor in the development of neural tube
defects in the developing foetus. Folic acid also has a role in the process of
cell division and also contributes to maternal tissue growth during pregnancy.

Female reproductive health

Certain nutrients can play a role in helping support reproductive health in
women. Pregnacare® Conception includes zinc which contributes to normal
fertility and reproduction whilst vitamin B6 contributes to the regulation of
hormonal activity. The formula also includes vitamin B12, iron, magnesium and
vitamin D which have a role in the process of cell division.

All-round nutritional support

Pregnacare® Conception provides all round nutritional support including biotin &
copper which contribute to normal energy release and iron which contributes to
the normal function of the immune system & formation of red blood cells and
haemoglobin. Vitamins B6 & B12 are contribute to the normal functioning of the
nervous system. The formula also includes other key nutrients; L-Arginine,
Inositol, N-Acetyl Cysteine and Betacarotene.

This product is designed for women of child-bearing age. 
*The beneficial effect is obtained with a supplemental folic acid daily intake
of 400mcg for at least one month before and up to three months after conception.

Wellman® Conception Tablets For Men

Supporting reproductive health

When couples decide to try for a family, it is not only women who should look
after their diet and lifestyle in order to maintain their health and support
conception.

Introducing Wellman® Conception

Wellman® Conception recognises that men have distinct reproductive health needs
of their own. Many men now recognise the importance of and adopting a healthier
lifestyle when trying for a baby.

Wellman® Conception has been developed to provide a comprehensive combination of
vitamins and minerals and bio-active nutrients to help support all round health
and vitality including iron which contributes to normal energy release, as well
as specific nutrients which have been chosen for their role in fertility and
reproduction.

Nutritional Support for Fertility

Wellman® Conception is a comprehensive formulation with specific nutrients,
including zinc which contributes to normal fertility and reproduction. Zinc and
vitamin C both contribute to the protection of cells from oxidative stress, and
also help contribute to the normal function of the immune system.

Zinc is arguably one of the most important minerals for the male reproductive
system as semen contains 100 times more zinc than is found in the blood. In fact
each ejaculation contains around 5mg of zinc; one half of the whole recommended
daily nutrient intake, therefore 15mg of zinc has been included within the
formulation.

Conception & Spermatogenesis

Vitamin B6 contributes to the regulation of hormonal activity, zinc contributes
to normal testosterone levels in the blood and selenium contributes to normal
spermatogenesis. It is now known that folic acid not only plays a critical role
in female conception, for the early development of the foetus, but is also
important for the male's role in conception too. Folic acid, iron, magnesium and
vitamin B12 have a role in the process of cell division, plus vitamin A, which
has a role in the process of cell specialisation.

For all round health and vitality

Vitamins B6 & B12 along with copper, iron and zinc contribute to normal energy
release. Folic acid, vitamin B6, riboflavin (vit. B2) contribute to normal red
blood cell formation as well as iron, contributes to normal formation of red
blood cells and haemoglobin which carries oxygen and blood to the reproductive
organs. Vitamins B6 & B12 contribute to the normal functioning of the nervous
system. The formula also includes other key nutrients; Peruvian MACA Extract,
Co-Q10, Lycopene, Siberian Ginseng Extract and Pine Bark Extract.

When to use Pregnacare® His & Her Conception

Men and women should use Pregnacare® His & Her Conception as soon as they start
trying for a baby. To help build the body's nutritional stores it can even be
taken for 3-6 months before you start to try for a baby. Once you have confirmed
you are pregnant, women can continue to use up any remaining Pregnacare®
Conception tablets, before moving on to Pregnacare® , Pregnacare® Plus with
Omega-3 or Pregnacare Max with Omega-3 plus Calcium which are specially
formulated for the remainder of your pregnancy. Following conception, men can
move onto Wellman® tablets which provide a comprehensive formulation of over 28

2404,Selfcheck Coeliac (Gluten Intolerance) Test,"The SELFCheck test provides an early detection of potential gluten
intolerance. Gluten intolerance can have debilitating influence on life, and
early indication allows you take further steps toward possible diagnosis coeliac
disease.

Features

• Simple, easy to follow instructions.
• No requirement to limit food or fluid intake prior to testing.
• Home testing - no need to send off for results.
• The test can be carried out at any time.
• The test provides a visible result within 10 minutes.

What are the benefits of testing for gluten intolerance?

Gluten intolerance is a lifelong genetically inherited intestinal disorder,
where the inner surface of the small intestine is damaged through eating food
containing gluten.

Gluten intolerance can present a range of symptoms, including:

 * Mild weakness
 * Mouth ulcers
 * Chronic diarrhoea
 * Abdominal bloating
 * Weight loss

These symptoms may vary in intensity and therefore contribute to an overall
deterioration to an individual's wellbeing.

Who can use this test?

Everyone who experiences unexplained digestive problems or thinks they may be
gluten intolerant

How to use the test

 * The test requires a small drop of blood.
 * Visual results will be available within 10 minutes.
 * Read the full instruction leaflet contained in the pack before use.

How to read my results

 * If 2 lines appear on the strip, 1 on the T line and 1 on the C line there is
   a positive! Result and are gluten intolerant.
 * If 1 line appears on the test strip on the C line then there is
   a negative! Result and do not appear to be gluten intolerant.
 * If no lines appear on the test strip or 1 line appears on the T line then the
   test is invalid and needs to be repeated with a new test kit.

What are the next steps I can take if the result is positive?

If you test positive for gluten intolerance you should contact your doctor for
further tests and diagnosis. You should not avoid eating food containing gluten
(such as products made from wheat, rye or barley) in the meantime, as lowering

milk.

Features

 * Detects the presence of alcohol in breast milk

 * Fast, accurate results in 5 minutes

 * Easy to read results

 * Peace of mind so you can breast feed with confidence

Box contains

 * 10 individual tests in this pack

Why do I need this test?

Breast-feeding and alcohol don’t mix well. There is no level of alcohol in
breast milk that is considered safe for a baby to drink. When you drink alcohol,
it passes into your breast milk at concentrations similar to those found in your
bloodstream.

However, after nine long months of pregnancy, many mums are interested in having
an occasional or celebratory drink but worry about passing alcohol on to their
baby. The One Step® test removes any guesswork about whether you are passing the
alcohol onto your baby so that you can breast feed with confidence. It is easy
to use and gives results in just 5 minutes.

How to use:

 * Simply immerse the tip of the test into breast milk for 10-15 seconds, wait 5
   minutes and then compare the colour of the test pad to the accompanying
   colour chart. Any colour change indicates that alcohol is present, with
   darker shades of blue indicating higher alcohol content.

...then SnoozeShade for Infant Car Seats Classic can help you

SnoozeShade makes any time sleep time 
 
NOTE 1:  Medical professionals recommend that young babies spend as little time
as possible in infant carriers as the healthiest and optimal position is lying
horizontal. This is crucial for child development, relieves pressure on your
little one’s back and allows oxygen to be more easily exchanged.
 
NOTE 2:  It is very important that you read safety advices about babies being in
cars during hot weather. A child should never be left unattended (even for a
moment) in a car at any time, in any weather conditions. Please also always
ensure that there is air movement in the car – a car with closed windows heats
up very quickly.

 * Place your lid over your pump to stop contamination. Store milk in a glass or
   silicone container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Any extra milk can be
   frozen in the freezer. Make sure to label your milk with a date and only fill
   container ¾ full – allowing room for milk to expand

Tips:

If you are struggling to get your pump going, place a warm flannel across the
top of your breast and gently massage while your pump is attached. This will
encourage your let down. Also catch your milk that would otherwise be lost in a
breast pad by attaching your pump while feeding your baby on the other side.

2436,Midstream Ovulation Tests (Urine) - 5 Pack,"*PLEASE NOTE: THESE ARE SHORT DATED AND EXPIRE 05/2019*

Our Midstream Ovulation Tests are at a sensitivity of 20mIU and work to an
accuracy level of 99%.

An egg can only live for 24 hours or less after it is released, while sperm
survives only a few days in your body. Using our Midstream Ovulation Test helps
you predict the two most fertile days following a surge in the luteinizing
hormone (hLH) which usually comes before ovulation. Having intercourse within
these days will maximize your chances of becoming pregnant.

Each ovulation test is individually sealed in a foil pouch. 

When to start testing:

First, determine the average length of your mentrual cycle. The length of
menstrual cycle is the number of days from the first day of menstrual bleeding
to the day before bleeding begins on the next period. Determine the usual length
of the menstrual cycle over the lastfew months. Then refer to the Cycle Chart to
determine on which day of the menstrual cycle to begin testing.

Positive for L.H. surge

If two colour bands are visible and the test band is of equal or greater colour
intensity (darker) than the control band, this is a positive result and a good
indication that the L.H. surge is occurring. You should ovulate within the next
24-36 hours. Sexual intercourse on the evening of the first positive test is
advised.

Negative for L.H. surge

If two bands are visible but the test band is of a less intense colour (paler)
than the control band or cannot be seen, this means the L.H. level is at or near
its normal level and that the surge is not in progress. You should continue with
daily testing.

Invalid result

If no control band appears within 5 minutes, the result is invalid and should be
ignored. A visible control line is needed in all cases to confirm a proper test
result.

post-pregnancy belly wrap (sold separately). Worn underneath your wrap, the
Belly Shield™ helps protect and restore your delicate skin with the help of
WonderWeave™. The Belly Shield™ features our proprietary WonderWeave™ material,
a comfortable, breathable fabric created to keep moisturizers (ex. stretch mark
cream, scar treatment after a C-section, or just your daily moisturizer) on your
skin and off of your belly wrap or clothes. 

Features:

 * Designed to fit perfectly underneath our Belly Bandit® post-pregnancy belly
   wrap (sold separately) to protect and restore your skin
 * Made with our exclusive WonderWeave™ material, designed to prevent creams and
   moisturizers from seeping onto your clothes, so your skin can absorb the

   Bandit® cleaner, longer!)
 * For Post C-Section Recovery: Adds an extra layer of protection over your
   incision, preventing abrasive rubbing and chaffing

Please Note: The Belly Shield™ is not a substitute for the Belly Bandit®
post-pregnancy belly wrap. The Belly Shield does not have any compression.

Belly Bandit Care Instructions:

Hand wash in cold water. Do not bleach. Rinse thoroughly. Lay flat and allow to
air dry. DO NOT twist or wring. Please note the Belly Bandit may take up to 12
hours to dry. 

HOW TO SIZE FOR YOUR BELLY BANDIT

Correct sizing is essential for comfort and product effectiveness. Buy ing a
Belly Bandit that is too large will not wear well under clothing and may affect
end results. There is no exact science that fits all women, but don't fret, here
are some tips we have found to be helpful... If you are purchasing a Belly
Bandit early on in your pregnancy, your best bet is to go up 1 to 2 band sizes
from your pre-pregnancy belly size.

In the eighth month many women will be the same size as they will be post
delivery. Simply measure the part of your tummy that is the biggest all the way
around your abdomen, which is usually at the belly button, and choose the
corresponding band for your size. Just prior to delivery simply subtract 3 to 5
inches from your belly measurement. Select the corresponding band for that size.
If you purchase your Belly Bandit after you give birth, simply choose the
corresponding band for belly size. The Belly Bandit is designed with five inches
of adjustability to stay tight as you shrink.

HOW YOUR BELLY BANDIT® SHOULD FIT.

When you try on your Belly Bandit® for the first time the ends should barely be
touching. That's right, if you can pull the Velcro closed it is too big! If the
ends of the band are 1-2 inches shy of closing DO NOT EXCHANGE for a larger
size. Simply lay down on a flat surface with the band beneath you and try
closing it or get a little help from your partner! If you find the band to be
extremely tight you can wear it for a few hours each day until you begin to
shrink in to the size. You’ll soon be wearing it around the clock!

2472,Pregnacare Liquid 200ml,"Pregnacare is the UK's most popular pregnancy supplement brand, and is trusted
by mums to safeguard the diet of those who are planning for pregnancy or are
already pregnant. 

Pregnacare Liquid is a scientifically developed formulation of 18 important
vitamins and minerals, including 400mcg folic acid and 10mcg vitamin D, the
exact levels as recommended by the UK Department of Health. Pregnacare Liquid
has been carefully developed by experts so that all ingredient levels are within
safe levels for pregnancy and are moderate rather than excessive.

Expert liquid nutrition for mother and baby

Pregnacare Liquid has been developed as an alternative supplement format for
those who may have difficulty in swallowing tablets or simply prefer a liquid
format. Providing an ideal alternative to tablets, the great tasting orange
flavour liquid is gentle on the stomach.

Recommended level of folic acid & vitamin D

The UK Department of Health recommends all women planning a baby should take a
supplement containing 400mcg of folic acid and 10mcg vitamin D from the start of
trying to conceive until the 12th week of pregnancy. This is the exact amount of
folic acid contained in Pregnacare Liquid. Supplemental folic acid intake
increases maternal folate status†. Low maternal folate status is a risk factor
in the development of neural tube defects in the developing foetus. Folic Acid
is also beneficial beyond 12 weeks as it contributes to maternal tissue growth
during pregnancy.

With vitamin B12 and zinc

Many studies show the importance of ensuring the correct intake of various
vitamins and minerals throughout the entire pregnancy and while you are a new
mum. Pregnacare provides a range of nutrients for overall support, all at
sensible, carefully balanced comprehensive levels, including vitamins B2, B6 and
B12 which contribute to normal red blood cell formation. Also includes zinc
which contributes to normal reproductive health.

Pregnacare avoids high dose iron which is not recommended

Unlike some prenatal iron supplements, Pregnacare has been specifically
formulated with an ideal, moderate level of iron. High levels of iron are not
recommended unless there is a particular requirement as identified by your
healthcare professional.

Specially formulated by experts

Pregnacare has been formulated by Vitabiotics experts during pregnancy to help
safeguard a mother's diet. Pregnacare provides a comprehensive spectrum of
essential nutrients at carefully chosen safe levels, developed on the basis of
international research. Pregnacare is proud to work in partnership with the
Royal College of Midwives to support the health of mothers and babies by raising
awareness of the benefits of good nutrition.

Before conception and during pregnancy

Pregnacare is recommended before conception to build up the stores of nutrients
such as iron in women who are trying for a baby. Good nutrition is important to
help prepare a woman's body for the additional demands placed on it during
pregnancy. Certain nutrients, like folic acid, vitamin B12 and zinc are also of
particular importance from the very first moment of conception. Zinc contributes
to normal fertility and reproduction whilst vitamin B12 contributes to normal
red blood cell formation and also has a role in the process of cell division. It
also includes iodine which is often recommended during pregnancy.

For all of pregnancy

Good nutritional intake is vital throughout pregnancy, not just the first 12
weeks. Pregnacare Liquid provides essential nutrients throughout pregnancy
including folic acid which has an important role during the full nine months and
contributes to normal blood formation. You can start taking Pregnacare at any
point during pregnancy.",https://www.inhealth.ie/pregnacare-liquid-200ml/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-1jn0h8pjbp/products/2472/images/9329/Pregnacare_Liquid_200ml__91323.1625061313.386.513.jpg?c=2,11.99,EUR,5021265246694,5937,Vitabiotics,5937,5021265246694,5021265246694,,FALSE,

What does the “BPA and BPS Free” Icon on your packaging mean?

The chemical bisphenol-A (BPA) is widely known to be a hormone disrupter. Acting
like an estrogen imposter, BPA has been linked to cancer, type 2 diabetes,
depression, heart disease and a number of other ailments. BPA can be especially
dangerous in pregnancy, infancy and childhood – so much so that many governments
around the world have banned BPA in the production of baby bottles (as well as
other products).

The chemical bisphenol-S (BPS) is used as a plasticizer by some manufacturers
and, in many cases, has been used to replace BPA. BPS is also a hormone
disrupter, but is currently allowed for the production of baby bottles and
similar products.

Because safety is a top priority for Lansinoh, we have taken proactive measures
to ensure our Lansinoh® mOmma® bottles with NaturalWave® Nipples are BPA and BPS
free.

HOW TO SIZE FOR YOUR BELLY BANDIT

Correct sizing is essential for comfort and product effectiveness. Buy ing a
Belly Bandit that is too large will not wear well under clothing and may affect
end results. There is no exact science that fits all women, but don't fret, here
are some tips we have found to be helpful... If you are purchasing a Belly
Bandit early on in your pregnancy, your best bet is to go up 1 to 2 band sizes
from your pre-pregnancy belly size.

In the eighth month many women will be the same size as they will be post
delivery. Simply measure the part of your tummy that is the biggest all the way
around your abdomen, which is usually at the belly button, and choose the
corresponding band for your size. Just prior to delivery simply subtract 3 to 5
inches from your belly measurement. Select the corresponding band for that size.
If you purchase your Belly Bandit after you give birth, simply choose the
corresponding band for belly size. The Belly Bandit is designed with five inches
of adjustability to stay tight as you shrink. 

HOW YOUR BELLY BANDIT® SHOULD FIT.

When you try on your Belly Bandit® for the first time the ends should barely be
touching. That's right, if you can pull the Velcro closed it is too big! If the
ends of the band are 1-2 inches shy of closing DO NOT EXCHANGE for a larger
size. Simply lay down on a flat surface with the band beneath you and try
closing it or get a little help from your partner! If you find the band to be
extremely tight you can wear it for a few hours each day until you begin to
shrink in to the size. You’ll soon be wearing it around the clock!

Plus dual pack provides the original, fully comprehensive multivitamin tablet
(which delivers the essential nutrients for pregnancy including the recommended
level of 400mcg folic acid and 10 mcg vitamin D), plus an additional Omega-3
capsule to provide a rich source of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which contributes
to normal brain and eye development of the foetus**.

Features :

28 x Pregnacare® multi-nutrient tablets with 400mcg Folic Acid

 * Pregnacare® Tablets contain a careful formulation of 19 nutrients important
   for both mother and baby
 * Carefully developed by experts so that all ingredient levels are within safe
   levels for pregnancy and are moderate rather than excessive
 * These include vitamin B12 plus vitamin D and folic acid at the exact level
   recommended for the development of the unborn baby
 * Supplemental folic acid intake increases maternal folate status†.
 * Low maternal folate status is a risk factor in the development of neural tube
   defects in the developing foetus.

28 x Omega-3 capsules with 300mg DHA

 * The capsules contain high purity fish oil, which are a rich source of the
   important Omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA. DHA is especially important during
   pregnancy as it contributes to normal brain and eye development of the
   foetus**.
 * One Pregnacare® Omega-3 capsule per day provides 300 mg DHA, the exact level
   recommended by international experts in lipid nutrition*** for pregnant and
   lactating women, plus 60mg EPA.
 * Pregnacare® Plus does not contain fish oil sourced from tuna, shark, marlin
   or swordfish. The UK FSA advises pregnant women, and women intending to
   become pregnant to avoid shark, marlin and swordfish and not to eat large
   amounts of tuna.
 * Only the purest pharmaceutical grade fish oil produced in Norway has been
   used in Pregnacare® Plus capsules
 * To ensure maximum benefit the oil is carefully concentrated to increase its
   DHA and EPA content and further purified
 * Each batch is rigorously tested, certified, and fully compliant with
   stringent EC and WHO rules on environmental pollutants
 * Natural lemon oil is included in the shell of Pregnacare® Plus capsules as an
   odour-mask for women who find it difficult to take fish oil supplements

More Info :

Vitamin D in Pregnancy

The Department of Health recommends that all pregnant and breast-feeding women
take a supplement containing 10mcg vitamin D, which is the exact amount found in
Pregnacare®.

Vitamin E in Pregnancy

Vitamin E contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress.
Pregnacare® contains a low recommended dietary intake of 4mg. This is present in
the natural form which is better absorbed by the mother than synthetic vitamin
E.

The Importance of Omega-3 fatty acids

Adults can obtain DHA and EPA indirectly through the conversion of the essential
fatty acid alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), present in vegetable oils such as linseed
but this process is very inefficient. Fish oils provide a much more reliable,
direct source of DHA and EPA. The foetus and infant in early life need to
receive these fatty acids directly as they only have a limited capability to
convert essential fatty acids to more active long chain fatty acids such as DHA.

Brain and eye development

DHA is the predominant fatty acid in the central nervous system, found in the
structural walls of brain cells. Amazingly, the foetal brain is made up of 60%
fats of which 40% is DHA. There is a large increase in DHA uptake by the foetus
and a corresponding increase in cerebral DHA content during the last trimester
of pregnancy and the first post natal months.1,2 At birth the baby's brain
weight is about 70% of an adult's brain weight; 15% of brain growth occurs
during infancy and the pre-school years.

DHA is important throughout this period of development.³ DHA is found in even
greater concentrations in the retina, where it contributes up to 60% of the
fatty acid content.

Maintaining Maternal Health

During pregnancy, the growing foetus and placenta can increase certain maternal
nutritional requirements. As it can be difficult to maintain this requirement
through diet alone, supplementation with Pregnacare is often recommended by
midwives† to safeguard a mother's diet.

mum, that does two important jobs.

   opens fully for easy access to baby.
 * Best suited to babies aged 6m+ who are sitting up. Also protects from wind,
   chill and insects
 * Sunshade - it has one of the highest levels of sun protection of any product
   on the market. The large soft mesh window means baby can enjoy the sights
   shaded from 80% of UV.
 * Sleep aid - use the outer ‘snooze panel’ to create the shade and seclusion
   that helps your baby sleep. Check quietly on your sleeping baby via the
   sneak-a-peek zip.

It’s perfect for holidays, days out, exercising with the buggy, popping to the
shops or just when you want to keep the sun from getting in your baby's eyes

provides protection from wind, chill and insects when the central panel is
closed or in sleep mode

   to your child
 * an alternative colour choice of lustrous grey with black trim (instead of the
   Classic black and cream)
 * an integrated front pocket to store shade and snooze panels when not in use
 * safety certified poppers (instead of Velcro).

Note: Your pram or pushchair must have a sun canopy/hood for use with
SnoozeShade. Will it fit your pram or buggy? Don't worry, we’ve not found one
worldwide it doesn’t fit.

2509,Ovulation Tests - 10 Tests,"The Core Test Ovulation Test strip is most economical way to test for ovulation.
The test strip will detect your LH (Luteinizing Hormone) Surge which is when you
are most fertile. It is as accurate as chemist brands but we bring it to you at
a fraction of the cost suitable for couples who will be testing a lot. The test
works by simply dipping it in to urine and one of two results will appear: one
line indicates you are not ovulating, while two lines means you are ovulating
and is it’s a good time to have intercourse and enhance the possibilities of
conceiving.

Key Features:

 * The most economical way to test for ovulation.
 * As accurate as chemist brands, at a fraction of the cost.
 * Easy to use.
 * Increased chance of contraception when used.

How to Use:

 * The test strip and urine have to be at room temperature for testing
 * Remove the test strip from the sealed pouch
 * Immerse the strip into urine with the arrow pointing towards the urine
 * Take the strip out after three seconds and lay the strip flat on a clean,
   dry, non-absorbent surface
 * Important: do not allow the urine level to exceed the Max line, otherwise the
   test will not perform correctly
 * Read results in five minutes. Do not read results after five minutes.

*Do NOT use First Morning Urine as LH is synthesised in your body early in the
morning. It will not show up in your urine until later in the day. The best time
to collect your urine is between 10am-8pm. Reduce liquid intake about 2 hours
before collecting your urine as diluted urine samples can prevent the test from
detecting LH surge.

LH Surge (Positive)

If two colour bands are visible and the test band is equal to or darker than the
control band, one will probably ovulate in the next 24-48 hours. If trying to
get pregnant the best time to have intercourse is after 24 hours but before 48
hours.

No LH Surge (Negative)

Only one colour appears on the control region, or the test band appears but is
lighter than the than the control band. This means there is no LH Surge.

Invalid

No visible band at all, or there is a visible band only in the test region and
not in the control region. Repeat with new test kit. If test still fails, please
contact medical test centre.

days) if you have recently been: breastfeeding; using hormonal contraception or

**Clearblue recommends that you test from the day your period is due. However,
the pregnancy hormone increases rapidly in early pregnancy and Clearblue can be
used to test up to 3 days before your period is due. In clinical testing with
early pregnancy samples Clearblue gave the following results: 74% of women
received a ‘Pregnant’ result 3 days early, 91% of women 2 days early, 96% of
women 1 day early. If you test early and get a ‘Not Pregnant’ result it is
possible that the level of pregnancy hormone may not yet be high enough to be
detected. You should test again when your period is due.

Free Mama Mio Tummy Rub Butter 30ml
[%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/free-mama-mio-gift-with-purchase/] when you spend €40 or
more on Mama Mio

Protect, cool and soothe pregnant and new mama boobs. Rich in organic Omega oils
to hydrate and elasticise and natural firmers and antioxidants to strengthen
skin and stop sagging

 * Pregnancy and breastfeeding safe – from the experts
 * Protects delicate skin experiencing cup size changes
 * Unique Green Cabbage Leaf Extract to ease swelling

How to use: Apply from below boobs up to neck daily throughout pregnancy and for
the first 6 months as a new mum. Team this up with our Keep Calm Nipple Balm if
breastfeeding.

Fit Skin Tip: To protect your boobs from stretch marks, be sure to use Tummy Rub
Butter or Oil on them during pregnancy and for 4 months after baby arrives. For
added sag protection and extra soothing, layer Pregnancy Boob Tube over your
Tummy Rub of choice to make sure you are protected against both stretch marks
AND sagging.

How it works: Cups that runneth over are one of the perks of new mama-hood but
we all know that those great pregnancy and nursing boobs are not a permanent
perk – they are on loan and the rent is high! The skin on your décolleté is
fragile and not very elastic, so you need to protect it from rapid growth during
all those cup size changes (in both directions). Pregnancy Boob Tube is rich in
vital Omegas (which are naturally depleted during pregnancy and nursing) to help
lock in hydration, strengthen and elasticise. We’ve also added natural firmers
and antioxidants to protect skin from sagging. We have even sourced the
incredible extract from cabbage, the age-old secret to help soothe swollen
nursing boobs.

its own natural pain relieving chemicals known as Endorphins.

stimulation for three seconds each i.e. 2/100 stimulation produces a
simultaneous activation of the of the enkephalin and dynorphin systems which
creates a more potent analgesic effect to combat pain. Published in the January
issue of 2003 of ""Trends in Neuroscience."" (26:17-22).

2663,Haakaa Silicone Breast Pump with Suction Base 150ml,"The revolutionary Haakaa Silicone Breast pump is a must have for breastfeeding
mothers everywhere and really is the simplest way to express anytime, anywhere.
It suctions onto the breast and then the pump does the work for you, drawing
your milk naturally. So you can use it solely to catch additional milk or while
travelling, or it can completely replace your electric pump.


Key Features :

 * 100% food grade silicone.
 * Saves every drop of breastmilk produced instead of losing it in nursing pads.
 * Easy to use, easy to clean.
 * Dishwasher safe.
 * No cords, batteries or assembly required.
 * Suction base ensuring your pump will not fall over.
 * 150ml / 5.4oz milk collection capacity.
 * BPA, PVC and Phthalate free

How to use:

 * Clean and sterilise before first use.
 * Suction your breast pump over your nipple. Your nipple should be positioned
   inside the neck of the pump and feel comfortable. If you need to release some
   suction simply allow more air into the pump.
 * Once the pump is attached gently squeeze the bottom of the pump to encourage
   let down.
 * Once milk begins to flow do not touch your pump and allow the container to
   fill with milk.
 * Remove once your pump is full or you have stopped feeding.
 * Place your lid over your pump to stop contamination. Store milk in a glass or
   silicone container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Any extra milk can be
   frozen in the freezer. Make sure to label your milk with a date and only fill
   container ¾ full – allowing room for milk to expand.
 * If you are struggling to get your pump going place a warm flannel across the
   top of your breast and gently massage while your pump is attached. This will
   encourage let down. Also catch your milk that would otherwise be lost in a
   breast pad by attaching your pump while feeding your baby on the other side.

When you become pregnant your body starts to produce the pregnancy hormone,
human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG). The amount of hCG in your body doubles
every 2 - 3 days in the early stages of pregnancy, and reaches a maximum at
around 7 - 12 weeks into the pregnancy.

over 99% accurate in laboratory tests when used from the day your period is due.",https://www.inhealth.ie/clearblue-pregnancy-test-1-test/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-1jn0h8pjbp/products/2682/images/6221/clearblue-pregnancy-test---1-test__22422.1524056538.386.513.jpg?c=2,9.99,EUR,4084500477520,4147,Clearblue,4147,4084500477520,4084500477520,,FALSE,

[%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/blog/the-biggest-lessons-we-learned-about-our-health-in-2015/]

Important Information:

Blood specimens containing below cases may give inaccurate glucose results.

 * Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) greater than 150mg/gL
 * Amiloride greater then 20 mg/dL
 * Acetaminophen greater than 8 mg/dL
 * L-Dope greater than 20 mg/dL
 * Dopamine greater than 20 mg/dL
 * Methyl-Dope greater than 4mg/dL
 * Galactose greater than 400 mg/dL
 * Urid acid greater greater than 10.5 mg/dL
 * Xylose greater than 50 mg/dL

Cholesterol up to 500 mg/dL or triglycerides up to 3000 mg/dL do not
significantly affect the glucose results. Grossly lipaemic patients samples have
not been tested and are not recommended for testing glucose level with EasyTouch
GC System.
Hematocrit (percentage of red blood cells in your blood) below 30% or higher
than 55% was found to cause a higher or lower reading, respectively. No
significant effect on the reading was found for hematocrits in the blood sample
between 30% and 55%.

Blood specimens containing ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) greater than 5mg/dL, uric
acid greater than 20mg/dL, aczetaminophen greater than 15mg/dL, L-Dopa greater
than 1.25 mg/dL, Dopamine greater than 3 mg/dL, Methyl-Dopa greater than 5
mg/dL, Glibenclimide greater than 10 mg/dL, creatinine greater than 20 mg/dL and
Billirubin greater than 20 mg/dL may give inaccurate glucose results.

Blood specimens containing ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) greater than 5mg/dL,
acetaminophen greater than 15mg/dL, L-Dopa greater than 1.25 mg/dL, Dopamine
greater than 3 mg/dL, Methyl-Dopa greater than 5 mg/dL, Glibenclimide greater
than 10 mg/dL, creatinine greater than 20 mg/dL and Billirubin greater than 20
mg/dL may give inaccurate cholesterol results.

Checking your blood glucose level and cholesterol level regularly can help you
identify whether your current lifestyle is putting your future health at risk.
Diabetes UK estimates there are 7 million pre-diabetic people in the UK and over
1 million UNDIAGNOSED type 2 diabetics. Why is this bad? Unmanaged diabetes can
lead to blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. On average diabetics die
10 years prematurely. The only way you really know if you are at risk of
becoming diabetic is to measure your blood glucose level. High total cholesterol
in your blood is a risk factor associated with heart attacks, angina, strokes
and much more. HEART UK estimates that 6 in every 10 of us have a raised
cholesterol level. There are often no symptoms of high cholesterol and so the
only way you know you have it is if you get it measured. Thankfully, prediabetes
and high cholesterol can be reversed and help prevent future illness by adopting
small lifestyle changes, such as eating healthier and exercising. This
dual-function single monitor offers an easy way to keep a check of your glucose
and total cholesterol levels. Simple to use, this small unit comes in its own
protective carry case which can also house your lancing device and test strip
containers. You can trust this device to be accurate time and time again. The
test strips for this device are some of the cheapest available on the market
providing you with an affordable way to keep a check on two of your Lifestyle
Markers (Glucose and Total Cholesterol).

The Easytouch GC is fully CE marked under EC directive 98/79/EC Annex IV,
Article 3 for home & professional use. CE registration number HL 600202810001.
Furthermore official testing shows Easytouch GC to have an accuracy level equal
to other leading brands.

Cholesterol & glucose screening has never been so accessible. Our economically
priced test strips make the Easytouch GC testing system the most competitive
device of its type worldwide. Accurate enough for the professional yet easy to
use and affordable enough for the patient.",https://www.inhealth.ie/easy-touch-blood-glucose-cholesterol-monitoring-system/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-1jn0h8pjbp/products/2683/images/9331/Easy_Touch_Blood_Glucose_Cholesterol_Monitoring_System__32001.1625232285.386.513.jpg?c=2,69.99,EUR,4710614722149,4321,Easy Touch,4321,4710614722149,4710614722149,,FALSE,

How Mama Mio Megamama Super-Rich Omega Body Lotion works: 

Mama Mio are such massive fans of the powers of Omegas... Omegas are so vital
for the health of your skin and you want to keep that pregnancy glow forever.

Mama Mio created Megamama to replenish your skin throughout the months of
pregnancy and early motherhood to give you an amazing super-safe lotion that
keeps your skin stretchy and strong. They know how hard your body is working
right now – it is making a mini miracle! So you need to feed it right, inside
AND out. Megamama is rich in vital Omegas and superfoods to give your skin that
nourishment every day. Pumpkin Seed Oil is incredible at helping relieve tense
stressed muscles (yes baby making is a serious job!) and Chia Seed is a
wonderful supergrain, rich in Omega 3 and antioxidants that are quickly absorbed
to boost radiance and help with skin sensitivity, breakouts and itchiness. Mama
Mio also added a multi-fruit blend that helps with skin radiance and clarity in
case excess skin pigmentation is a concern.

Megamama is free from parabens, petrolatum, synthetic fragrance and colourants,
xenoestrogens, PEGs and phthalates. If skincare safety is your concern, rest
assured you are in safe hands with Mama Mio. 

Directions: Treat yourself to a daily application of Mama Mio Megamama
Super-Rich Omega Body Lotion on shower damp skin (if you don't make it to the
shower, use on dry skin... your secret is safe with us). Smooth upwards from
tippy toes to shoulders to replenish, revitalise and nourish dry skin. You
should be using Tummy Rub Butter or Oil to baste your most stretch mark prone
areas (boobs, bellies and bottoms) during and for four months after pregnancy.
Megamama is for dry skin all over (legs, arms, shoulders...).

Fit Skin Tip: Dry brushing exfoliates to get rid of dead cell build up, but it
also stimulates circulation, which means your skin gets more of the oxygen and
nutrients that keep skin happy and healthy. Dry brush your skin 3-4 times a week
during pregnancy. 

Another Fit Skin Tip: Make sure you are taking a high dose Omega supplement
throughout your pregnancy and don't forget to keep supplementing after babe is
born.

involved with drugs. Parents often feel they don’t know enough about drugs to
help prevent their child from coming to harm. These are simple, fast, reliable
and accurate tests which detect for the presence of drugs of abuse in urine. 

This drug cassette will test your urine for the following drugs:

 * Speed (AMP)
 * Benzodiazepines (BZO)
 * Buprenorphine
 * Cocaine (Crack) (COC)
 * Ketamine
 * Marijuana (Cannabis) (THC)
 * Methadone
 * Methamphetamines (MAMP)
 * Morphine
 * Opiates (Heroine)

Key Features:

 * Easy to use, with fast, accurate and reliable results.
 * All tests are CE Marked and FDA Approved, with an accuracy level of 99%.

How to Use:

You can take the test at any time.

 * Bring the pouched test device to room temperature (15-30 degrees) prior to
   testing. Do not open the pouch until ready to perform the assay. 
 * Remove the test panel from the sealed pouch.
 * Remove the protective cap and immerse the strips in urine specimen with the
   arrow end pointing towards the specimen for at least 10 seconds. Do not
   immerse the strips above the plastic device.
 * Replace the cap and lay the test device on a flat, clean and dry surface. 
 * Read test results between 3-8 minutes.
 * NOTE* Insufficient specimen volume or incorrect procedural techniques are the
   most likely reasons for the control line failure. Review the procedure and
   repeat the test with a new device.
 * NOTE** In order to avoid an incorrect result, do not read the test result
   after more than 10 minutes as the intensity of the colored lines may change
   or a new line may appear after 10 minutes. To avoid confusion, discard the
   test device after interpreting the result.

NEGATIVE: Two coloured lines are visible, one in the control region and another
one in the test region. No matter the color intensity of the test line is weaker
or stronger than that of the control line,the test result is negative, which
indicates that the free drug is absent or less than the detection level of the
test.

POSITIVE: Only one coloured line is visible in the control region with no
apparent line in the test region. The test result is positive, which indicates
that the free drug is present in the urine at or exceeding the detection level
of the test.

INVALID: The test is invalid if the control line is not visible regardless of
the presence or absence of the test line.

Methamphetamines and Benzodiazepines. Fast and reliable, visible results within
5 minutes. 
Kit includes everything you need to carry out the test: 1 multi panel cassette,
and full instruction leaflet.

Facts about Drugs and this Test: Many parents worry about their children
becoming involved with drugs. Employers have a duty to ensure as far as
reasonably possible that their employees are not a danger to themselves, other
employees or members of the public by consuming drugs of abuse. The idea of
testing urine for the presence of drugs of abuse is to deter your child or staff
from using drugs. This test provides rapid information regarding the possible
use of the most commonly abused drugs.

How do I perform this test?
The test is conducted by immersing the test panel in a urine sample, and
interpreting the results from coloured lines. If a negative result is obtained,
then it is unlikely that the urine sample contained any of the drugs which were
tested. If a positive result is obtained for any of the specific drugs, it is
likely the urine sample contained traces of that particular drug.

Prevent Stretch Marks with Exfoliation

Exfoliation is the best way to fuel skin renewal and push damage up and out. The
natural acids in sugar sweep away dull, flaky surface skin prompting cellular
renewal in the lower layers.  Every time you scrub you trigger stretch mark
repair deep down where damage and loss of tone occur.

As you polish, thirsty skin pulls in nutrients. Whipped shea butter and
nourishing essential oils penetrate deeply and quickly for intense skin
fortification, better resiliency and stretch mark prevention.

Use Instructions

Use in the shower with deep circular movements to sweep away dry skin. Spend a
little extra time on those dry, rough spots on the elbows, hands and heels.

Gold Winner - Best Maternity/New Mum Skincare Product- LPD Awards 2017

The yummiest, purest, creamiest, melt in your skin butter we could possibly
make.  We loaded it with Omega 3, 6 and 9 to ensure your skin has the best
fighting chance against stretch marks. One scoop and you'll know our Tummy Rub
Butter deserves every award and accolade it has won. It smells gorgeous, makes
you feel gorgeous and is a pleasure to use.

Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Butter is your superhero in fighting stretch
marks. It is thick, rich and packed with skin-drenching nutrients – omega 3, 6
and 9 - the superfoods that your skin needs. Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Butter is a
deeply hydrating mix of Shea Butter, Borage Oil, Sweet Almond Oil and Wheatgerm
Oil. These omega-rich ingredients help prevent stretch marks by increasing skin
elasticity.

Shea Butter is the most potent healing butter. It helps restore skin tone and
provides a protective barrier to lock in moisture. Interestingly, it contains a
form of natural latex that helps build elasticity within skin to stave off
stretch marks.

Borage Oil is an ancient oil used in the Far East for thousands of years, it’s
one of the richest sources of Essential Fatty Acids omegas, specifically
gamma-linolenic acid (rich in omega 6) is very effective in healing damaged
skin. Borage Oil is wonderfully moisturising and very active as it is quickly
recognised and utilised by the skin.

Wheatgerm Oil is rich in Vitamin E and is amazingly healing and nourishing to
the skin. In addition Vitamin E is useful for its role as a powerful
anti-oxidant, soaking up free radicals (so that’s anti-aging) and helping those
omega-rich superfoods get on with their vital work.

Rosehip Seed Oil is very rich in omega 3 and omega 6, which are beneficial for
the treatment of damaged and distressed skin by providing intense
moisturisation. This oil has the added benefit of naturally occurring
trans-retinoic acid (think benefits of retin–A but without side effects) which
is very helpful in preventing stretch marks.

Sweet Almond Oil (cold-pressed to get the very best quality) is rich in all
omegas 3, 6 and 9, and very nourishing. It is highly moisturising and quickly
absorbed, leaving a soft sheen on the skin with no residue


How to use

Rub twice a day from above your boobs to below your butt – front, back and
sides. Keep rubbing for at least four months after baby has arrived on the
scene. Tummy Rub is not just about the growing it is also about the shrinking
back down to normal size and maintaining your skin tone

The First Trimester (0 -12 weeks)

The first three months of pregnancy are in many ways the most crucial stage of a
baby’s development - the time when all of his or her organs and systems are
forming, as well as hands, feet, and limbs. It is now recognised that a mother’s
diet immediately before conception and in the first weeks of pregnancy can
influence the way that the embryo develops. Investing at this stage in the best
nutrition may not only help support your baby's start to life, but also give you
a better chance of a healthy pregnancy. 

The new formulation of Vital Essence 1 supplies all the micro-nutrients that are
most important to meet the demands of early pregnancy, including 400ug of Folic
Acid (useful for a whole range of cellular activities, not just for helping to
minimise the risk of spina bifida) plus lots of protective ingredients such as
Beta Carotene (a safe way to help support your intake of Vitamin A), Copper,
Magnesium, Manganese and Zinc, all of which  support normal cell division and
help to protect DNA. Take one capsule, three times a day (with food), alongside
a good quality diet, to help support the changing demands of your body during
the first three months of your pregnancy.

We recommend that it should be taken in conjunction with Vital DHA for maximum
benefit to your overall nutrition.

All Zita West products are developed in response to the very latest research and
are regularly reviewed and reformulated to remain at the cutting-edge of
clinical and nutritional thinking for optimum reproductive health.

Directions For Use

Take one capsule three times a day with food. Should only be taken on a full
stomach. Suitable for vegetarians. Free from artificial colours, preservatives
gluten and yeast. Non-GM.

If under medical supervision, seek guidance from your medical practitioner
before using this product.

2842,Buy 2 Get 1 Free Multi-Mam Balm - Nipple Care For Breastfeeding Mums,"Multi-Mam Balm is recommended for preventing cracked nipples and improving the
condition of nipple area tissue. Non-sticky and easily absorbed, it protects the
nipple area by replacing and supplementing the natural skin fat, and does not
have to be removed before breastfeeding. 

Features :

 * Protects the nipples before and during breastfeeding
 * Prevents cracking and keeps the skin soft, supple and healthy
 * Plant-based alternative to Lanolin
 * Easy to apply

Questions:

Do I need to remove Multi-Mam Balm before breastfeeding?

 * No, it is harmless when swallowed and has a neutral taste and smell. It is
   especially recommended to apply the balm right after breastfeeding – if
   applied just before feeding, it can make latching on more difficult for your
   baby.

How often do I need to use Multi-Mam Balm?

 * As often as you like. It is especially recommended to apply the balm right
   after breastfeeding.

What is the difference between Multi-Mam Balm and Multi-Mam Lanolin?

 * Multi-Mam Balm is based on a selection of plant oils. It is a plant-based
   alternative to Lanolin, which is based on natural wool fat. 

I continually suffer from cracked nipples, which is very painful. What can I do?

 * Use a cream that softens and restores the skin tissue, and does not need to
   be removed before breastfeeding. Multi-Mam Balm reinforces and conditions the
   skin tissue. Based on herbal ingredients, it is tasteless and harmless when
   swallowed, so can give optimal protection during feeding and throughout the
   day. 

What are the causes of nipple problems?

 * Most nipple injury results from a poor latch; it is important that the most
   sensitive part of the nipple tissue is pulled deeply into your baby’s mouth.
   Using products that diminish the skin’s natural protection, such as soaps and
   shampoos, can also cause cracked nipples. Finally, yeast infections, eczema,
   or a tendency for dry skin are potential causes of nipple problems",https://www.inhealth.ie/buy-2-get-1-free-multi-mam-balm-nipple-care-for-breastfeeding-mums/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-1jn0h8pjbp/products/2842/images/9002/Multi-Mam_Balm_-_Nipple_Care_For_Breastfeeding_Mums_BOGOF_1__00351.1606825250.386.513.jpg?c=2,19.99,EUR,99,5193A,Multi Mam,5193A,99,99,,FALSE,

The new Sea-Band Mama! Range has been specially created to help soothe and calm
your tummy during your pregnancy so that you can start enjoying this special
time again.

Get a Helping Hand to Relieve Your Morning Sickness

Many expectant mothers suffer from morning sickness and most find their symptoms
ease at around week 14, but for an unlucky few nausea and vomiting may continue
throughout the pregnancy. Scientific studies have proved that one of the most
effective drug-free treatments is Acupressure on the P6 (Nei-Kuan) point between
the two central tendons near the wrist.

In the UK, acupressure was first scientifically proven useful for this condition
by the late Professor John Dundee from Queens University, Belfast. An Italian
study has also found that morning sickness was reduced in 70% of women who used
Sea-Bands.

The plastic stud on Sea-Bands applies continuous pressure on each wrist
preventing or relieving the feeling of nausea.

Recommended by midwives and pregnant women around the world, the Sea-Band Mama!
acupressure wrist band provides a natural choice for effective morning sickness
relief

How to Position Your Sea-Bands

Here’s how to find the acupressure point (called The Nei-Kuan Point). Place your
middle three fingers on the inside of your wrist with the edge of the third
finger just below the first wrist crease. The Nei-Kuan point is located
underneath your first (index) finger in-between the two wrist tendons.

Position the plastic stud facing inward over The Nei-Kuan Point. Repeat for your
other wrist. One band must be worn on each wrist to be e!ective.

Sea-Band takes between two and five minutes to become effective. A better result
is achieved if the band is in place before your nausea commences. Greater relief
can be gained if necessary by applying extra pressure to the plastic stud.",https://www.inhealth.ie/morning-sickness-sea-band-mama/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-1jn0h8pjbp/products/2878/images/5449/sea-band-mama-band__90883.1524056546.386.513.jpg?c=2,9.99,EUR,5015259007361,5939,Sea Band,5939,5015259007361,5015259007361,,FALSE,
2880,Pregnacare Original - 30 Tablets,"Pregnacare prenatal supplement is the most popular and trusted by mums to
safeguard the diet of those who are planning for pregnancy or are already
pregnant. A scientifically developed formulation of 19 important vitamins and
minerals, 

Expert nutrition for mother and baby

Pregnacare contains 400mcg folic acid and 10mcg vitamin D, as advised by the UK
Department of Health D during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Pregnacare has been
carefully developed by experts so that all ingredient levels are within safe
levels for pregnancy and are moderate rather than excessive.

Recommended level of folic acid & vitamin D

The UK Department of Health recommends women planning a baby should take a
supplement containing 400mcg of folic acid from the start of trying to conceive
until the 12th week of pregnancy. This is the exact amount of folic acid
contained in Pregnacare. Supplemental folic acid intake increases maternal
folate status†. Low maternal folate status is a risk factor in the development
of neural tube defects in the developing foetus. Folic Acid is also beneficial
beyond 12 weeks as it contributes to maternal tissue growth during pregnancy.

Important: Some pregnancy formulas do not include the exact 10 mcg vitamin D, as
advised by the UK Department of Health D during pregnancy and breast-feeding.

More than folic acid alone - with B12 and key minerals

Many studies show the importance of ensuring the correct intake of various
vitamins and minerals throughout the entire pregnancy and as part of an
aftercare plan. Pregnacare provides a range of nutrients for overall support,
all at sensible, carefully balanced levels, including vitamins B2, B6 and B12
which contribute to normal red blood cell formation.

Pregnacare avoids high dose iron which is not recommended

Unlike many prenatal iron supplements, Pregnacare has been specifically
formulated with an ideal, moderate level of iron. High levels of iron are not
recommended unless there is a particular requirement as identified by your
healthcare professional.

Before conception

Pregnacare is recommended before conception to build up the stores of nutrients
such as iron in women who are trying for a baby. Good nutrition is important to
help prepare a woman's body for the additional demands placed on it during
pregnancy. Certain nutrients, like folic acid, vitamin B12 and zinc are also of
particular importance from the very first moment of conception. Zinc contributes
to normal fertility and reproduction whilst vitamin B12 contributes to normal
red blood cell formation and also has a role in the process of cell division.

For all of pregnancy

Good nutritional intake is vital throughout pregnancy, not just the first 12
weeks. Pregnacare provides essential nutrients throughout pregnancy including
folic acid which plays an important role during the full nine months and
contributes to normal blood formation. You can start taking Pregnacare at any
point during pregnancy.

Specially formulated by experts

Pregnacare has been formulated by experts to help safeguard a mother's diet
during pregnancy. It provides a comprehensive spectrum of essential nutrients at
carefully chosen safe levels, developed on the basis of international research.
It has always contained the recommended level of 400mcg folic acid**. Pregnacare

the health of mothers and babies by raising awareness of the benefits of good
nutrition.",https://www.inhealth.ie/pregnacare-original-30-tablets/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-1jn0h8pjbp/products/2880/images/6571/pregnacare-original---30-tablets-sale__22592.1524056546.386.513.jpg?c=2,7.99,EUR,5010058089785,5938,Vitabiotics,5938,5010058089785,5010058089785,,FALSE,

2893,Vitabiotics Wellwoman 50 Plus 30 Tablets,"Wellwoman 50+ has been specifically designed to help safeguard the nutritional
needs of women aged 50 and above and forms part of the Wellwoman range, the UK's
number 1 women's supplement brand. There is now a great deal of research
evidence to suggest that micronutrient supplementation in individuals aged over
50 can be beneficial. Wellwoman 50+ contains a comprehensive range of 26
vitamins, minerals and plant derived nutrients to support key areas of health
important to women over 50, including heart, brain and eye health.

Supporting an Active Lifestyle

Getting older shouldn't mean you should have to change your lifestyle and the
activities you have always enjoyed. Wellwoman 50+ contains vitamins B6 and B12,
copper and iron which contribute to normal energy release. Immune health is also
a serious consideration as you get older. Zinc, selenium and vitamins B6, B12 C
and D have also been included in the formula as they contribute to the normal
function of the immune system.

Normal Vision

Your eyes are one of the most complex organs and as you get older it's even more
important than ever to look after them. The retina and the lens can be damaged
over the years by exposure to sunlight, smoke and pollution. Wellwoman 50+
provides antioxidants vitamin C and E which contribute to the protection of
cells from oxidative stress with mineral zinc, which contributes to the
maintenance of normal vision.

Heart and Circulation

Wellwoman 50+ contains thiamin (vit.B1) which contributes to the normal function
of the heart as well as a combination of folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12
which contribute to normal homocysteine metabolism, and normal red blood cell
formation. The formula also includes vitamin C which increases non-haem (plant
source) iron absorption. This is especially important with vegetarian diets as
iron contributes to the normal formation of haemoglobin and normal oxygen
transport in the body to all the major organs.

Brain and Nervous System

Thiamin (vit. B1) and vitamins B6 and B12 with biotin and vitamin C contribute
to the maintenance of normal function of the nervous system, combined with
pantothenic acid which contributes to normal mental performance.

Directions for use

One tablet per day with your main meal. Swallow with water or a cold drink.
Swallow without chewing.

GOLD WINNER - BEST MATERNITY/NEW MUM SKINCARE PRODUCT- LPD AWARDS 2017

The bestselling Tummy Rub Butter has been supersized! 

The yummiest, purest, creamiest, melt in your skin butter we could possibly
make.  We loaded it with Omega 3, 6 and 9 to ensure your skin has the best
fighting chance against stretch marks. One scoop and you'll know our Tummy Rub
Butter deserves every award and accolade it has won. It smells gorgeous, makes
you feel gorgeous and is a pleasure to use.

Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Butter is your superhero in fighting stretch
marks. It is thick, rich and packed with skin-drenching nutrients – omega 3, 6
and 9 - the superfoods that your skin needs. Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Butter is a
deeply hydrating mix of Shea Butter, Borage Oil, Sweet Almond Oil and Wheatgerm
Oil. These omega-rich ingredients help prevent stretch marks by increasing skin
elasticity.

Shea Butter is the most potent healing butter. It helps restore skin tone and
provides a protective barrier to lock in moisture. Interestingly, it contains a
form of natural latex that helps build elasticity within skin to stave off
stretch marks.

Borage Oil is an ancient oil used in the Far East for thousands of years, it’s
one of the richest sources of Essential Fatty Acids omegas, specifically
gamma-linolenic acid (rich in omega 6) is very effective in healing damaged
skin. Borage Oil is wonderfully moisturising and very active as it is quickly
recognised and utilised by the skin.

Wheatgerm Oil is rich in Vitamin E and is amazingly healing and nourishing to
the skin. In addition Vitamin E is useful for its role as a powerful
anti-oxidant, soaking up free radicals (so that’s anti-aging) and helping those
omega-rich superfoods get on with their vital work.

Rosehip Seed Oil is very rich in omega 3 and omega 6, which are beneficial for
the treatment of damaged and distressed skin by providing intense
moisturisation. This oil has the added benefit of naturally occurring
trans-retinoic acid (think benefits of retin–A but without side effects) which
is very helpful in preventing stretch marks.

Sweet Almond Oil (cold-pressed to get the very best quality) is rich in all
omegas 3, 6 and 9, and very nourishing. It is highly moisturising and quickly
absorbed, leaving a soft sheen on the skin with no residue

How to use

Rub twice a day from above your boobs to below your butt – front, back and
sides. Keep rubbing for at least four months after baby has arrived on the
scene. Tummy Rub is not just about the growing it is also about the shrinking

2915,Clearblue Pregnancy Test - 2 Tests,"Clearblue Pregnancy Test - Lowest Price in Ireland Guaranteed!

The Clearblue Pregnancy Test is the most popular product on the market, and has
been trusted by women for many years. It is remarkably simple to use, and lets

solution for those who are eager to find out the result.

Consider these advantages
The Clearblue Pregnancy Test is easy to use and 99% accurate when used from the

Simply hold the test under flowing urine and wait for the Colour Change Tip to
indicate that it has worked.
After two minutes, the results window will show a clear ‘+’ for pregnant, or ‘-‘
for not pregnant.
The pack contains two tests.

How do Pregnancy Tests work?
When you become pregnant your body starts to produce the pregnancy hormone,
human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG). The amount of hCG in your body doubles
every 2 - 3 days in the early stages of pregnancy, and reaches a maximum at
around 7 - 12 weeks into the pregnancy.
Clearblue Pregnancy Tests work by detecting the presence of hCG. They are all
over 99% accurate in laboratory tests when used from the day your period is due.",https://www.inhealth.ie/clearblue-pregnancy-test-2-tests/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-1jn0h8pjbp/products/2915/images/5273/clearblue-twin-pregnancy-test---2-tests__57711.1524056548.386.513.jpg?c=2,12.99,EUR,4084500477445,4148,Clearblue,4148,4084500477445,4084500477445,,FALSE,

2921,Belly Bandit (Bamboo) - Post Pregnancy,"From Belly Bandit [%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/belly-bandit-2/] comes the
best-selling Bamboo post-pregnancy belly belt, to help shrink and tighten your
tummy and regain your shape faster.

Key Features:
 
 * Shrinks your belly, waist & hips
 * Most popular style
 * Made from super-soft bamboo that is moisture wicking and antimicrobial (so
   comfortable it's recommend for c-section mamas)
 * Recommended by doctors: you can start wearing the Belly Bandit immediately
   after delivery
 * Holds your post-delivery loose skin, decreasing tension - this helps to
   prevent stretch mark formation in the postpartum period
 * Provides comfort after C-Section by protecting the incision, thus
   accelerating healing
 * Supports the back, legs and core muscle structure, forcing your lower back to
   straighten promoting good posture which is especially crucial during
   breastfeeding
 * Helps treat diastasis recti by pulling together the two halves of the
   outermost abdominal muscle (recti) and heal the weakened connective tissue 

How To Use:

The Belly Bandit should be worn all day including during sleep (only taking it
off to shower) for a minimum of 6-8 weeks in order to receive maximum belly,
waist and hip shrinking benefits. Most women will see huge results in the first
5 days when worn as directed and others within the first 2-3 weeks! You can wear
it while you are working out. The constant pressure on your belly will remind
you to engage your core.

The ends of your Belly Bandit should just touch, about 1-2 inches shy of
closing, to achieve the best end results. If you find the band extremely tight
in the beginning, simply lay down on a flat surface with the band beneath you
and have someone assist you in closing the Velcro and wear it for a few hours
each day. As you begin to shrink, you will soon be wearing it around the clock.

More Info:

HOW TO SIZE FOR YOUR BELLY BANDIT:

Correct sizing is essential for comfort and product effectiveness. Buying a
Belly Bandit that is too large will not wear well under clothing and may affect
end results. There is no exact science that fits all women, but here are some
tips we have found to be helpful: if you are purchasing a Belly Bandit early on
in your pregnancy, your best bet is to go up 1 to 2 band sizes from your
pre-pregnancy belly size. In the eighth month many women will be the same size
as they will be post delivery. Simply measure the part of your tummy that is the
biggest all the way around your abdomen, which is usually at the belly button,
and choose the corresponding band for your size. Just prior to delivery simply
subtract 3 to 5 inches from your belly measurement. Select the corresponding
band for that size. If you purchase your Belly Bandit after you give birth,
simply choose the corresponding band for belly size. The Belly Bandit is
designed with five inches of adjustability to stay tight as you shrink.

HOW YOUR BELLY BANDIT® SHOULD FIT:

When you try on your Belly Bandit® for the first time the ends should barely be
touching. That's right, if you can pull the Velcro closed it is too big! If the
ends of the band are 1-2 inches shy of closing DO NOT EXCHANGE for a larger
size. Simply lay down on a flat surface with the band beneath you and try
closing it or get a little help from your partner! If you find the band to be
extremely tight you can wear it for a few hours each day until you begin to
shrink in to the size. You’ll soon be wearing it around the clock!

Care Instructions:

Hand wash in cold water. Do not bleach. Rinse thoroughly. Lay flat and allow to
air dry. DO NOT twist or wring. Please note the Belly Bandit may take up to 12
hours to dry.

2 x FertilCheck Female Fertility Tests

2 x FertilCount Male Fertility Tests 

This kit measures sperm count in men and the sex hormone FSH in women.

The babystart¨ FertilTests fertility screening test for both men and women,
measures sperm count in men and the sex hormone FSH in women. This is a
combination twin test pack for couples to share in the privacy of their own
home. For the women there is the babystart¨ FertilCheck Female Fertility
screening test for women which measures the sex hormone that is an indicator of
a their biological fertility clock.

A woman’s fertility starts to decline after she gets to 30 and the decline
gradually accelerates until she gets to menopause. This reduction in fertility
is reflected in a similar gradual increase in the the hormone FSH (follicle
stimulating hormone). Rising levels of FSH tend to be associated with reduced
fertility. The FSH hormone can also be raised in women with irregular periods
and without doubt will steadily rise as a woman gets older. As menopause
approaches the levels get particularly high and act as an early warning system
for peri-menopause. The babystart¨ FertilCheck Female Fertility home diagnostic
screening test is a rapid test of FSH concentration in urine. The kit contains
two ECOstripª Female Fertility tests and if both test results are positive it is
an indicator of reduced fertility. The test is greater than 99% accurate. With
this test a negative result is going to be good news although its not proof of
fertility. A positive test result suggests that fertility is reduced and we
recommend that a woman see her doctor to discuss the results and perhaps have
more tests done.

For the man the babystart¨ FertilCount Male Fertility test is a rapid diagnostic
test of sperm concentration in semen. Sperm count is widely recognised as the
major indicator of the fertility in men. There is a one test kit and a two test
kit. The World Health Organisation has defined a man’s fertility on the basis of
the concentration of sperm in semen with the cut off point being set at 15
million sperm per mL of sperm. The babystart¨ FertilCount Male Fertility test
kits are a unique home test that will tell you if a man’s sperm concentration is
greater or less than the WHO cut off point. A positive result is going to be
good news although its not proof of fertility. A negative result suggests then
man should see his doctor, which is not all bad news, because it does at least
save the a couple months of futile trying for a baby.

The babystart¨ FertilCheck Female Fertility test kit and the babystart¨
FertilCount Male Fertility test kit will allow a couple planning a pregnancy to
test their fertility potential, privately and discreetly in their own home.

2939,Babystart FertilMan Plus Sperm Development Supplement 30 Days,"Babystart® FertilManplus™ is a nutritional supplement formulated to support
sperm quality. Sperm quality relates to motility, count/concentration,
morphology and volume. Babystart® FertilManplus™should be taken by men that have
a known sperm quality problem or in support when, as a couple, a pregnancy is
not occurring. The formulation contains no herbals, only pure scientifically
proven compounds, with known effects, giving babystart® FertilManplus™ a high
“quality” status.

Studies show that L-Carnitine and anti-oxidant supplementation, Glutathione in
particular, can improve sperm quality, and possibly increase the chances of
conception. There is strong clinical evidence to show that men diagnosed with
infertility have high levels of oxidative stress that may impair the quality of
their sperm. Previous evidence has also shown that oxidative stress can decrease
a sperm's life span, its motility, and its ability to penetrate the oocyst, or
egg cell.

Nutritional therapies and antioxidants that have proven beneficial in treating
male infertility and improving sperm counts, sperm morphology and motility
include:

L-Carnitine, L-Arginine, Zinc, Selenium, Vitamin A, B Vitamins, Vitamin C,
Vitamin E, Glutathione, Coenzyme Q10 and Folic Acid, ALL of these are included
in the formulation of the babystart® FertilManplus™ sperm supplement.

babystart® FertilManplus™ has been formulated to provide a unique nutritional
supplement for use by men when planning a pregnancy. The ingredients have been
carefully selected and are used in moderate safe levels according to EU
standards. The formulation contains no herbals, only pure scientifically proven
compounds with known effects giving babystart® FertilManplus™ a high “quality”
status. Only those ingredients known to especially benefit fertility, conception
and pregnancy are included. It has also been carefully formulated to help
safeguard dietary requirements as soon as you start trying to conceive. This
unique blend of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and anti-oxidants, are carefully
chosen because of their properties beneficial to sperm production.

babystart® FertilManplus™ is blister packed to keep each tablet fresh by
reducing exposure to the atmosphere. There are 120 tablets in each packet, take
two tablets, twice per day as per the instructions.

2990,Babystart Fertilmate Scrotum Cooling,"Dozens of issues can affect testicular temperature with the most common examples
being extended period of sitting and sleeping in a sideways position.
FertilMate™ Scrotum Cooling Patches work by promoting coolness and building a
significant improvement over a six-month period. 
 * The FertilMate Patch helps maintain an optimal temperature beneficial to
   spermatogenesis.
 * Comfortable: simple to apply, adheres gently and removes easily without
   sticky or greasy residue.
 * Recommended Use: testicular temperature is affected by numerous issues, some
   of which are medical problems and some of which are man made. Driving and
   sitting for hours at work increases testicular temperature, as does sleeping,
   particularly if you sleep on your side.
 * FertilMate helps reduce testicular temperature in these 'warm' working and
   'warm' sleeping periods.
 * Frequency of use: the FertilMate Cooling Patch should ideally be used for six
   months, although initial improvements in sperm quality may be seen after
   three months. At the very least, we recommend that one full 'initial cycle'
   of 16 days should be the minimum usage for couples in the family planning
   process
 * Cooling: the FertilMate Patch helps maintain an optimal temperature
   beneficial to spermatogenesis.
 * Soothing: natural, relaxing, long-lasting cooling right where you need it.
 * Effective: FertilMate will immediately feel cool or slightly 'tingy' and this
   effect will last for 2-4 hours, while the soothing effect will last much
   longer. After 6-8 hours we recommend that the patch is replaced with a fresh
   one.
 * Recommended Use: testicular temperature is affected by numerous issues, some
   of which are medical problems and some of which are man made. Driving or
   sitting for hours at work increases testicular temperature, as does sleeping
   and particularly if you sleep on your side.
 * FertilMate helps reduce testicular temperature in these 'warm' working and
   'warm' sleeping periods.
 * Spermatogenesis: sperm development is called spermatogenesis. Each
   spermatogenesis cycle has about six stages. The duration of each cycle is
   about 16 days. Five cycles are required to produce one mature sperm.
   Therefore, it takes approximately 86 days for a complete spermatogenetic
   cycle. Because the process is so complex, any illness or prolonged raised
   testicular temperature events during the first cycle could affect sperm
   formation and these events tend to affect ALL the sperm, not just one or two.
 * Frequency of use: the FertilMate Cooling Patch should ideally be used for six
   months, although initial improvements in sperm quality may be seen after
   three months. At the very least, one full 'initial cycle' of 16 days should
   be tried and that is why each full boxed set of FertilMate contains 16
   pouches (two patches per pouch), as we recommend the wearing of one patch
   during working hours and one during sleeping hours.

A relationship between experimental elevation of testis temperature and poor
semen quality has been known for over eighty years.
Experience shows that prolonged reduction of the temperature of the scrotal area
by about 2 to 5 degrees C., may be effective in reversing male infertility and 
there are numerous published study data to support this theory",https://www.inhealth.ie/babystart-fertilmate-scrotum-cooling/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-1jn0h8pjbp/products/2990/images/7079/Babystart_Fertilmate_Cooling_Hydrogel_Scrotal_Patches__36058.1539597460.386.513.jpg?c=2,12.99,EUR,5060069350503,40742,BabyStart,40742,5060069350503,5060069350503,,FALSE,

Free Mama Mio Tummy Rub Butter 30ml
[%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/free-mama-mio-gift-with-purchase/] when you spend €40 or
more on Mama Mio

100% moisture and natural goodness, full of Omega 3, 6 and 9 – but it isn't at
all oily (weird but true). Your thirsty skin immediately soaks it up leaving it
super soft with a protective sheen. After 15 years of trials, we know this is
the best stretch mark protection oil we can make. So it is no surprise to us
that it has won a lot of awards and has been the subject of countless emails of
thanks. We loved using it because it smells gorgeous and makes you feel gorgeous
and, seven babies later, our skin still looks good.

Key Features:

 * Every ingredient in Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil has a distinct
   moisturising purpose and is laden with Omega 3, 6 and 9 – superfood for the
   skin. Our Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil is a perfectly balanced blend of four
   oils:
 * Sweet Almond Oil (cold-pressed to get the very best quality) is rich in all
   important omegas and very nourishing. It is highly moisturising and quickly
   absorbed, leaving a soft sheen on the skin with no residue.
 * Borage Oil is an ancient oil used in the Far East for thousands of years,
   it’s one of the richest sources of Essential Fatty Acids omegas, specifically
   gamma-linolenic acid (rich in omega 6) is very effective in healing damaged
   skin. Borage Oil is wonderfully moisturising and very active as it is quickly
   recognised and utilised by the skin.
 * Wheatgerm Oil is rich in Vitamin E and is amazingly healing and nourishing to
   the skin. In addition Vitamin E is useful for its role as a power-full
   anti-oxidant, soaking up free radicals (so that’s anti-aging) and helping
   those superfoods get on with their vital work.
 * Rosehip Seed Oil is very rich in omega 3 and omega 6, which are beneficial
   for the treatment of damaged and distressed skin by providing intense
   moisturisation. This oil has the added benefit of naturally occurring
   trans-retinoic acid (think benefits of retin–A but without side effects)
   which is very helpful in preventing stretch marks.

How to use

 * Rub in twice a day from above your boobs to below your bum and all the way
   round.
 * You will want to use it for at least four months after baby has arrived in
   your world because it helps keep your skin toned and tight as you shrink back
   down to normal.

2998,Zita West - Vital Essence 3 (For Your 3rd Trimester),"FOR WEEKS 28-40 OF PREGNANCY

Three tablets a day of this supplement contain all the important nutrients your
body needs to prepare for labour. It contains Zinc, an important element in
hormone production, and extra Iron to safeguard your reserves and to meet the
demands of your baby.

Vital Essence 3 is suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. It is free from
artificial colours, preservatives and gluten and is certified non-GM.

Allergen Information

From Soya: Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), Soya Oil, Natural Mixed
Tocopherols

The Third Trimester (28 - 40 weeks)

In the third trimester your blood volume increases by 40 percent, your pelvic
joints expand and your breast tissue develops. Your baby is growing faster than
at any other time in your pregnancy, doubling in size, increasing nerve cells,
strengthening bones, maturing lungs, immune system and digestive tract, and
laying down stores of fat, Iron, and Calcium. Brain cells are multiplying faster
than at any other time in his or her life.

Vital Essence 3 is designed to help meet all these needs and to help you keep as
fit and healthy as possible in preparation for labour, birth, and
breast-feeding. We recommend that you take Vital Essence 3 in conjunction
with VitalDHA.

The formulation contains 30 of the most important micro-nutrients for this key
stage of your pregnancy, including Calcium, to help with muscle growth and nerve
and muscle functions, and Magnesium to help with the synthesis of protein and
healthy cell division. Most of a baby's Calcium is deposited in this trimester
as his or her bones and teeth harden. The foetus takes up Calcium at the rate of
approximately 350mg a day during this stage of the pregnancy, so it is good to
have a plentiful supply to prevent it being scavenged from your own skeleton.
There's plenty of Iron too, to help support your immune system and with the
manufacture of red blood cells in preparation for the birth, as well as
good levels of Vitamin D and Vitamin B3. We've also included Choline to help
support the structural integrity of your cell membranes, as well as Iodine, Co
Q10 and Folic Acid. The formula also contains Beta Carotene, to help protect
against possible Vitamin A deficiency, plus a wide range of other ingredients,
such as Lutein, Lycopene, Alpha-Lipoic Acid and Pomegranate and Grapeskin
Extracts.

Directions For Use:

Take one capsule three times a day with food. Should only be taken on a full
stomach. Suitable for vegetarians.

3050,Kegel8 Glide Gold Vaginal Probe,"*This is a replacement probe only, you will need a Kegel 8 machine to use this.

The Kegel8 Glide Gold Vaginal Probe is an innovation in pelvic floor toner
probes and we believe it is the best single-channel probe available today.

Its ergonomic shape glides easily into position and is comfortable to use. We
have eliminated the protruding stem which makes seated pelvic floor exercises
very uncomfortable and even impossible with most other probes. Seated pelvic
floor exercise positions aren't just more convenient at times, they actually
optimise your posture which is clinically proven to give better results. The
simplistic nature of its design makes it one of the most lightweight vaginal
probes available today. When using your Kegel8 pelvic toner in a standing
position, the Glide will stay effortlessly in place and won't fall out.

Inserting the Kegel8 Glide is simple, insert the probe with the electrodes
positioned hip-to-hip with the 'scoop' shape downwards; it glides into position
effortlessly, naturally fitting the contours of your body. And removal is just
as easy; we've reinforced the wires of the probe with an outer casing which
seals them from moisture ingress but also provides a pull tab so you can
comfortably slide the probe out of position without damage to the wires.

What's so unique about the design of the Kegel8 Glide Gold Vaginal Probe?

The Kegel8 Glide Gold Vaginal Probe features 2 electrodes both carefully
positioned to stimulate the back part of the pelvic floor; this is where the
majority of the pelvic floor muscles are positioned which will give you
noticeable results, faster.

And of course, our electrodes are gold plated - you'd expect nothing less from
Kegel8! Gold plated electrodes not only make a probe suitable for those with a
nickel intolerance (that's 10% of the UK population that are aware of their
allergy) but gold is also a much better conductor than silver, so you'll feel
far stronger and more effective stimulation pulses.

If you have a prolapse, we know just how difficult it can be to find a probe
that is comfortable and right for you. With the Kegel8 Glide we've solved that
problem; with no hollows that can tug and snag causing discomfort, we have
managed to maintain a width that will provide effective contact with the pelvic
floor muscles. What's more, the scoop design actually offers support to your
prolapse whilst you exercise, making it the perfect accompanying probe to the
Kegel8 Ultra 20 with its clinically proven programme to treat prolapse.

   levels according to EU standards
 * Contains no herbals, only pure scientifically proven compounds
 * Only those ingredients known to especially benefit fertility, conception and
   pregnancy are included

Vitamins, minerals and amino acids for mother and baby...

With babystart FertilCare no longer is there need to purchase complicated and
expensive combinations of vitamins and minerals - just 1 tablet a day provides
safe levels of essential nutrients for conception and beyond. FertilCare has
been formulated to provide a single unique nutritional supplement for use by
women when planning a pregnancy. The ingredients have been carefully selected
and are used in moderate safe levels according to EU standards. The formulation
contains no herbals, only pure scientifically proven compounds with known
effects giving FertilCare a high “quality” status. Only those ingredients known
to especially benefit fertility, conception and pregnancy are included. It has
also been carefully formulated to help safeguard dietary requirements as soon as
you start trying to conceive and contains essential vitamins, minerals and
nutrients such folic acid, zinc, vitamin B6 and particularly vitamin B12, iron,
magnesium and vitamin D3 which contribute to normal cell division and neural
tube development early in pregnancy. FertilCare should then continue to be taken
during pregnancy as research has shown that even with a good diet, extra
nutrients may be required throughout the whole pregnancy.

Reproductive Health

Nutritional therapies and antioxidants that have proven beneficial in helping
support reproductive health in women include zinc which contributes to normal
fertility and reproduction and vitamin B6 which contributes to the regulation of
hormonal activity. The FertilCare formula also includes vitamin B12, iron,
magnesium and vitamin D, which contribute to normal cell division in early
pregnancy.

Nutritional support

FertilCare provides all round support with additional nutrients including biotin
& copper which contribute to normal energy release and iron which contributes to
the normal function of the immune system and formation of red blood cells and
hemoglobin. Vitamins B6 and B12 are also important to help maintain the normal
functioning of the nervous system. The FertilCare formula also includes
Beta-carotene and L-Arginine, which helps to stimulate the reproductive organs
in women by improving circulation. A lot of interest has been created by recent
research suggesting that L-Arginine can improve female libido. This could be
useful for the pre-conceptual couple.

3072,Wellman Conception 30 Tablets,"Wellman Conception forms part of the Vitabiotics Wellman range, the UK's number
1 men's supplement brand. Many men now recognise the importance of getting
themselves in shape and adopting a healthier lifestyle when trying for a baby
and Wellman Conception recognises that men have reproductive health needs of
their own.

Wellman Conception has been developed to provide a comprehensive combination of
vitamins and minerals and bio-active nutrients to help support all round health
and vitality, as well as specific nutrients which have been chosen for their
role in fertility and reproduction. One tablet should be taken daily as an
integral part of a healthy lifestyle, ideally three months before trying to
conceive, while, at the same time, Pregnacare Conception has been specially
designed for your partner, including vitamin B12, vitamin D and 400mcg folic
acid (Vit. B9).

Fertility and Reproduction

Wellman Conception is a comprehensive formulation with specific nutrients,
including zinc which contributes to normal fertility and reproduction. Zinc and
vitamin C also contribute to the protection of cells from oxidative stress, an
important consideration for healthy sperm production as sperm can be damaged by
free radicals. These nutrients also help contribute to the normal function of
the immune system.

Zinc is arguably one of the most important minerals for the male reproductive
system as semen contains 100 times more zinc than is found in the blood. In fact
each ejaculate contains around 5mg of zinc; one half of the whole recommended
daily nutrient intake, therefore 15mg of zinc has been included within the
formulation.

Conception and Spermatogenesis

Vitamin B6 contributes to the regulation of hormonal activity, while zinc
contributes to the maintenance of normal testosterone levels in the blood and
selenium contributes to normal spermatogenesis. Folate, iron, magnesium and
vitamin B12 have a role in cell division, plus vitamin A, which has a role in
the process of cell specialisation.",https://www.inhealth.ie/wellman-conception-30-tablets/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-1jn0h8pjbp/products/3072/images/6162/wellman-conception_2__03565.1524056554.386.513.jpg?c=2,15.99,EUR,5021265223534,40366,Vitabiotics,40366,5021265223534,5021265223534,,FALSE,

3090,Zita West - Vital Essence 2 (For Your 2nd Trimester),"FOR WEEKS 13-28 OF PREGNANCY

Vital Essence 2 has been formulated to meet the specific needs of your body
during weeks 13 - 28 of pregnancy. Each tablet is packed with specific vitamins
and minerals which are particularly important for this phase of your baby's
development.

Vital Essence 2 is suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. It is free of
artificial colours, preservatives and gluten and is certified non-GM.

One tablet taken three times a day (with or after food) will meet the growing
demands of you and your baby. We recommend that Vital Essence 2 should be taken
in conjunction with VitalDHA.

Vital Essence2 - 90 tablets (1 month's supply)

Allergen Information

From Soya: Vitamin E (as D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), Soya Oil, Natural Mixed
Tocopherols.

Contains yeast.

The Second Trimester (13-28 weeks)

By the second trimester your baby’s limbs will be fully formed and the joints
able to move. Eyelashes and eyebrows are beginning to grow, teeth are starting
to develop in the jaw bones and fat stores are being laid down. The organs are
maturing and the developing bones are continuing to ossify. The nervous system
is becoming more developed and the brain is beginning to rapidly increase in
size, its brain cells multiplying at an amazing 50,000 to 100,000 per second.

As your pregnancy progresses it is obviously important to make sure your vitamin
and mineral intake is protected. Your appetite should return as early feelings
of nausea and tiredness pass, but don’t be tempted to 'eat for two'. It is
quality not quantity that counts, and excess weight gained now may be hard to
shift later. Good nutrition is important for your baby’s development and for
your own health during the pregnancy.

Vital Essence 2 provides everything you need to safeguard your everyday diet,
including 400ug of Folic Acid (useful for a whole range of cellular activities,
not just for helping to minimise the risk of spina bifida) plus lots of
protective ingredients such as Beta Carotene (a safe way to help support your
intake of Vitamin A), Copper, Magnesium, Manganese and Zinc, all of which 
support normal cell division and help to protect DNA. Take one capsule, three
times a day (with food), alongside a good quality diet.

We recommend that Vital Essence 2 should be taken in conjunction with VitalDHA
for maximum benefit to your overall nutrition. 
 
All Zita West products are developed in response to the very latest research and
are regularly reviewed and reformulated to remain at the cutting-edge of
clinical and nutritional thinking for optimum reproductive health.


Directions For Use:

Take one capsule three times a day with food. Should only be taken on a full
stomach. Suitable for vegetarians.

If under medical supervision, seek guidance from your medical practitioner
before using this product.

3101,Digital Basal Thermometer For Fertility Charting,"The Digital Basal Thermometer allows a woman to determine her body temperature
for basal body temperature (BBT) charting purposes. Designed specifically for
fertility charting and predicting ovulation, it provides results to 1/100th of a
degree Fahrenheit. Because consistency and accuracy are critical, the
thermometer also offers helpful charting functions, such as digital memory
recall and a peak temperature indicator.

Key Features:


 * Digital display reads to 1/100th of a degree Fahrenheit (e.g. 97.56).
 * Certified accuracy to 1/10th of a degree.
 * Peak-temperature indicator sound.
 * Large, easy-to-read digital display.
 * Digital memory recall function for most recent reading.
 * Includes a replaceable battery, clear storage case and an ovulation chart.

How to use:

 * Take your temperature first thing in the morning. Use a digital BBT
   thermometer to take your temperature as soon as you wake up. Do it while
   you’re still lying down before you do anything else — even sitting up,
   talking or taking a sip of water.
 * Record your temperature. Plot your temperature on the BBT chart or record the
   data in a BBT app. (Make sure you’ve gotten at least three hours of
   uninterrupted sleep for the most accurate reading.) If you’re using a smart
   BBT thermometer, your temperature might get stored on your phone
   automatically. Your BBT rises about half a degree immediately after
   ovulation, so if the increase has held steady for three days or more, it’s
   safe to assume that you’ve ovulated.
 * Look for a trend. After a few months you should start to detect a pattern of
   temperature highs and lows. You can use that information to predict when
   you’ll ovulate during your next cycle.  
 * Have sex when you’re most fertile. Ovulation usually happens a day or two
   before your BBT rises. (For instance, if your BBT increase happens on day 16
   of your cycle each month, you’re probably ovulating on day 14 or 15.) Plan to
   have sex on the days that you’re ovulating, and give yourself some extra
   insurance by having sex one or two days before and after ovulation too.
   (Sperm can hang around for a few days waiting for the egg to show up.)

How to use your breast pump:

 * Sterilise your pump (caps are available online to purchase – caps keep the
   pump sterile after cleaning)

 * Place top of pump over your nipple – make sure your nipple is in the neck of
   the pump and comfortable.

 * Apply suction – you may need to adjust a couple of times. Once the pump is
   secure and comfortable you can squeeze the base of the pump (not interfering
   with the top/suction) to create some movement.

 * A warm flannel on top of your breast is also a great tip and gently massage
   the top of your breast.

 * Once milk begins to flow simply leave the pump alone to do its thing.

 * Once the pump becomes full empty into a glass storage bottle and reposition.

   base to the table next to you while you finish your feed or re dress and the
   pump is 100% secure.

Top Tips:

 * Also attach in the same way while your child is feeding on your other breast
   and collect all let down and milk which would other wise be lost into a
   breast pad.
 * Waking up in the middle of the night or if engorged during the day also
   attach your pump for relief.
 * Clean after each use. This product can be sterilised with any steam
   sterilising system or boiling water. 
 * If you are struggling to get your pump going place a warm flannel across the
   top of your breast and gently massage while your pump is attached. This will
   encourage your let down. Also catch your milk that would otherwise be lost in
   a breast pad by attaching your pump while feeding your baby on the other
   side.

3119,Haakaa Silicone Breast Pump 100ml with Suction Base & Lid,"The Haakaa Silicone Breastpump is a revolutionary product and really is the
simplest way to express anytime, anywhere you need to. It works by suctioning
onto the breast and then the pump does the work for you by suctioning and
drawing your milk naturally. So you can use it solely to catch additional milk
or while travelling or it can completely replace your electric pump and do all
your pumping for you.

Features:

 * 100% food grade silicone
 * Dishwasher Safe
 * Easy to use, easy to clean
 * No cords, batteries or assembly required
 * Suction base ensuring your pump will not fall over
 * Saves every drop of breastmilk produced instead of losing it in nursing pads

Specifications:

 * 100ml / 4oz milk collection capacity
 * BPA, PVC and Phthalate free

Box Contains:

 * 1 x 100ml / 4oz Haakaa breast pump with suction base
 * 1 x Lid

How to use your breast pump:

 * Clean and sterilise before first use.
 * Suction your breast pump over your nipple. Your nipple should be positioned
   inside the neck of the pump and feel comfortable. If you need to release some
   suction simply allow more air into the pump.
 * Once the pump is attached gently squeeze the bottom of the pump to encourage
   let down.
 * Once milk begins to flow do not touch your pump and allow the container to
   fill with milk.
 * Remove once your pump is full or you have stopped feeding.
 * Place your lid over your pump to stop contamination. Store milk in a glass or
   silicone container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Any extra milk can be
   frozen in the freezer. Make sure to label your milk with a date and only fill
   container ¾ full – allowing room for milk to expand

Tips:

If you are struggling to get your pump going place a warm flannel across the top
of your breast and gently massage while your pump is attached. This will
encourage your let down. Also catch your milk that would otherwise be lost in a
breast pad by attaching your pump while feeding your baby on the other side.

*Please note: The lid is designed to keep your pump sterile after cleaning, not
to keep your milk spill free or secure. If you wish to secure your pump from
spills please purchase our flower

3125,Snuza HeroMD Portable Baby Breathing Monitor,"The Snuza Hero Monitor is a medically certified portable baby breathing monitor,
for complete peace of mind. The monitor continuously checks in on your baby's
breathing while they sleep, if they stop breathing a gentle vibration will begin
to rouse your baby after 25 seconds. If this doesn't work the Hero will alarm so
that you can act and respond quickly and your baby will be in safe hands.

Key Features:

 * Snuza safely and conveniently monitors your baby to warn about weak or
   infrequent movement.
 * Cordless, easy to use, small and portable: simply clips to the waistband of
   your baby's diaper.
 * Built-in vibrating stimulator and an alarm to alert you of no movement. 15
   second vibration, 20 second alarm.
 * Low Movement Rate Warning.
 * Snuza can be used in conjunction with a baby sound or video monitor so that
   it can be heard in another room.

How To Use:

 * Clip the Snuza onto the waistband of your baby’s diaper and switch on.
 * The flexible sensor detects even the slightest movement.
 * The Snuza will alert you if your baby’s movements are very weak or fall to
   less than 8 movements per minute.
 * If no movement at all is detected for a period of 15 seconds, Hero will
   vibrate gently.
 * Often this vibration is enough to rouse the baby, and Hero will revert to
   monitoring mode. After three vibration/rouse incidents, the Rouse Warning
   will alert you to the fact that your baby’s movements have stopped for 15
   seconds on three occasions. If no further movement is detected for another 5
   seconds, an alarm will sound to alert you. 
 * The Snuza® HeroMD can pick up external movements and it is therefore not
   suitable for co-sleeping or bed-sharing. It is advisable not to use the
   Snuza® HeroMD when the baby is in motion, e.g. in a car seat or a stroller.
 * The battery size required is CR2 (this can be purchased at your local
   hardware store).

3161,Zita West - Revital Essence - Post Natal,"After you have given birth your body has another set of nutritional
requirements. Revital Essence includes important nutrients such as B vitamins,
which are important for lactation and Zinc, which is involved with hormonal
balance and the promotion of healing. We've added Choline too, an essential
nutrient necessary for the development of healthy cell membranes as well as a
broader and more effective range of valuable anti-oxidants to help support the
immune system. There's Korean Ginseng and Coenzyme Q10 as well, to help provide
some added energy.

Zita West Revital Essence is a premium vitamin and mineral supplement that aims
to help mums look after themselves, as well as their babies, following the
birth. It is easy to under-estimate the physical, mental and emotional demands
that these early months can bring for a new mother.

Allergen Information

From Corn: Modified corn starch

From Soya: Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate)

ReVital Essence - Ingredients and Their Benefits

B vitamins - important for lactation and to prevent blood sugar problems.

Co-enzyme Q10 helps release energy by releasing oxygen. Oxygen is needed for
tissue repair and immune function following the birth.

Ginseng - a helpful general pick-me-up tonic after the birth of a baby.

Iron - needed by both mother and baby to build up haemoglobin in the blood and
to prevent anaemia, especially when there has been considerable blood loss. Iron
also helps to fight infection and to supply oxygen to the muscles.

Vitamin C - helps wounds to heal by manufacturing collagen, connective tissue
and blood vessels. It strengthens the immune system, helps to fight infection
and increases the body’s absorption of iron. Extra is needed if you are breast
feeding.

Vitamin E - gives antioxidant protection and helps to promote wound healing.

Vitamin K - controls blood clotting. Your child cannot manufacture vitamin K
within his or her own gut yet and relies on breast milk for his or her supply.

Zinc - needed to aid wound healing and hormone production, to boost the immune
system and to help combat post-natal depression. Levels of copper (which is
antagonistic to zinc) rise during pregnancy, reaching a peak just after the
birth. Unless zinc levels are boosted, both mother and baby are likely to be",https://www.inhealth.ie/zita-west-revital-essence-post-natal/,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-1jn0h8pjbp/products/3161/images/4947/zita-west---revital-essence---post-natal__56069.1524056558.386.513.jpg?c=2,31.99,EUR,5060074940065,4289,Zita West,4289,5060074940065,5060074940065,,FALSE,

Belly Bandit that is too large will not wear well under clothing and may affect
end results. There is no exact science that fits all women, but don't fret, here
are some tips we have found to be helpful... If you are purchasing a Belly
Bandit early on in your pregnancy, your best bet is to go up 1 to 2 band sizes
from your pre-pregnancy belly size.

In the eighth month many women will be the same size as they will be post
delivery. Simply measure the part of your tummy that is the biggest all the way
around your abdomen, which is usually at the belly button, and choose the
corresponding band for your size. Just prior to delivery simply subtract 3 to 5
inches from your belly measurement. Select the corresponding band for that size.
If you purchase your Belly Bandit after you give birth, simply choose the
corresponding band for belly size. The Belly Bandit is designed with five inches
of adjustability to stay tight as you shrink.

HOW YOUR BELLY BANDIT® SHOULD FIT.

When you try on your Belly Bandit® for the first time the ends should barely be
touching. That's right, if you can pull the Velcro closed it is too big! If the
ends of the band are 1-2 inches shy of closing DO NOT EXCHANGE for a larger
size. Simply lay down on a flat surface with the band beneath you and try
closing it or get a little help from your partner! If you find the band to be
extremely tight you can wear it for a few hours each day until you begin to
shrink in to the size. You’ll soon be wearing it around the clock!

More and more women are making the switch to menstrual cups, not just because
they're better for the environment, but because they provide for easier, cleaner
and healthier periods. The Flow Cup sits comfortably inside the vagina creating
a suction, which collects all your menstrual blood. Unlike other possible
methods, which absorb not only blood, but vaginal fluid too which can disturb
the delicate PH and bacterial balance in your vagina leading to swelling,
dryness and odour.

 * Reusable, comfortable and safe.
 * Economical.

   your Flow Cup.

   stem pointing down, drain the water completely and dry.
 * Step 3. Place your finger on the top rim of your Flow Cup and press down into
   the center, forming a triangle shape. This makes the top rim smaller to
   insert. With one hand, hold the folded cup firmly.
 * Step 4. Finding a position which is comfortable for you, gently insert your
   Flow Cup into the vagina. Make sure you are relaxed when doing this and
   insert the cup on a straight angle. Make sure the cup expands completely
   after being inserted and until the stem is even with the vaginal opening.

How to remove:

used for rearward or forward-facing travel from 9 kg until 25 kg. Easily and
smoothly transfers between cars, thanks to its compact size and light weight.

Key Features:

 * Suitable from 9 month to 6 years
 * Recline Position: provides a comfortable sleeping position for your child.
   Simply adjust your seat before fitting it in the car. 
 * Removable Cover: machine-washable seat cover, can easily be removed so you
   can clean it up and get on your way quickly.
 * Extended Rearward Facing: in a frontal collision with a rearward facing seat
   the crash forces are directed to the back of the seat, while the remaining
   energy is spread evenly across the head, neck and upper body. With a forward
   facing seat the energy of the impact is distributed differently across the
   seat structure and restraint system – potentially resulting in more energy
   impacting on the child’s body. We recommend that children should travel
   rearward facing for as long as possible.
   
    

 * Protective Side Wings: padded side wings act as a protective cocoon that
   helps to absorb the force of a side impact.
 * 5 Point Safety Harness: a 5-point harness is the safest way to secure your
   child in a car seat because it keeps your child safe and tight in the seat’s
   protective shell. In the event of a collision, the harness distributes the
   forces of the impact across 5 points, two at the shoulders, two at the hips
   and one where the harness buckles between the legs.

naturally in cereals, fruits and nuts, many women with PCOS suffer from insulin
resistance due to an inositol deficiency. Supplementing with myo-inositol can
therefore assist in maintaining levels of this important nutrient. We have

from 34 weeks has been clinically proven to help stretch the perineum (the area

   the perineum. Find a place where you feel safe, comfortable and won’t be
   interrupted.
 * This could be still in the bath or in bed.
 * You might find it easier to use a mirror for the first few massages until
   you’re happy with the technique.

   within the back wall of your vagina, resting one or both forefingers on your

3630,Haakaa Flow Cup (Menstrual Cup) - Short Stem,"The Haakaa Flow Cup is the perfect alternative for women looking for a safe,
simple, economical and waste-free way to manage their periods. Made from 100%
soft and flexible silicone, the Haakaa Flow Cup is free from BPA, chlorine and
other harsh chemicals that are found in conventional pads and tampons.

Our Flow Cup sits comfortably inside the vagina, creating a seal that collects
your menstrual blood. Alternative methods like tampons can absorb additional
vaginal fluids, which can disturb the delicate PH and bacterial balance in your
vagina, leading to swelling, dryness and odour. Haakaa Flow Cups can be worn for
up to 12 hours and can be reused over and over!

The Haakaa Flow Cup has a shorter stem for comfort and is perfect for those who
usually need to trim the stem of other menstrual cups.

Features

 * 100% medical grade silicone.
 * Reusable, comfortable and safe.
 * Economical.
 * Two sizes to suit all women.
 * Easy to clean.
 * BPA, PVC and phthalate-free.
 * Includes hard carry case and cloth storage bag.

Instructions:

Please read the instructions below before using your Flow Cup.

 1. Always make sure you have clean hands before touching and inserting your
    Flow Cup.
 2. Sterilise your Flow Cup by boiling it in water for 2-3 minutes. Holding your
    Flow Cup with the stem pointing down, drain it completely of water and dry.
 3. Find a position that is comfortable for you. You can stand, sit, or put a
    foot up on the toilet - any position works, as long as you're relaxed.
 4. Place your finger on the top rim of your Flow Cup and press down into the
    centre, forming a triangle shape. This makes the top rim much smaller to
    insert.
 5. Hold the folded cup firmly in one hand and gently insert your Flow Cup into
    the vagina on a straight angle. Make sure the cup remains folded until it is
    completely inside your vagina and the stem is even with the vaginal opening.
 6. Let the cup pop open and check for folds or dents around the base. You'll
    know if your Flow Cup is inserted correctly if you can pull on the stem and
    feel resistance from the vacuum seal.

How to Remove:

Make sure you have clean and dry hands. Pull gently on the stem of the cup until
you reach the base of the cup. Pinch the base of the cup
to break the vacuum seal and continue to pull down gently until the cup is
removed. Empty your Flow Cup into the toilet and rinse with water before
reinserting. If your period has finished, sterilise your Flow Cup by boiling in
water for 2-3 minutes, then place it back inside its case.

Product Dimensions:

 * Small: 4.2cm x 6.3cm 
 * Large: 4.5cm x 6.6cm (recommended for women over 30 or post-childbirth)

Caution: Check product condition regularly. Replace if this product shows any
signs of damage. Discontinue use and consult your healthcare professional if you
feel any major pain or discomfort while using this product. Do not use any
bleach-based cleaners or tablets to clean your Flow Cup. To minimise the risks
of contracting deadly Toxic Shock Syndrome, do not leave inserted for longer
than 12 hours.

conception aid that will help increase your chances of getting pregnant faster.
It is designed to deliver as much sperm as possible to the cervix, when inserted
after ejaculation, helping improve your chances of conception.

Key Features :

 * Helpful when trying conceive at home.
 * Designed to deliver as much sperm as possible directly to the cervix.
 * Re-usable for up to 6 cycles.
 * Soft, flexible, 100% Medical grade silicone.
 * Manufactured in Switzerland.
 * Hormone-Free.
 * Easy to use and comfortable to wear.
 * The Ferti Lily Cup can remain in place for up to 1 hour.

How to Use :

 * Before inserting the cup for the first time, boil it in water and pat it dry.
 * Keep it within easy reach of your bed, in its handy cotton bag.
 * Insert it straight after ejaculation (without sitting or standing).
 * It can remain in place for up to an hour – even while urinating or showering.
 * Inserted into the vagina after ejaculation, the Ferti Lily pushes semen
   towards the cervix (the opening of the uterus), cradling the sperm in the
   protective environment of the cervical mucus. This way, more sperm cells
   survive and more of them can swim up into the uterus. And the more sperm
   cells enter the uterus, the higher the chances that one of them will reach
   and penetrate the egg - thus increasing the odds of conception.

Cup increases the amount of sperm brought to the cervix and increases the
chances of Conception, while the Conception Gel is sperm safe and enhances the
comfort and pleasure of conceiving.

Key Features:

 * Sperm-friendly lubricant.
 * Clinically Proven.
 * Mimics natural fertile fluids.
 * Contains Fructose, which gives sperm energy to swim.
 * 50ml flip-cap tube for optimal ease-of-use during intercourse.
 * Mid-market price point on sperm survival.

Box Contains:

How to use:

FERTI·LILY Conception Cup.

 * Before inserting the cup for the first time, boil it in water and pat it dry.
 * Keep it within easy reach of your bed, in its handy cotton bag.
 * Insert it straight after ejaculation (without sitting or standing).
 * It can remain in place for up to an hour – even while urinating or showering.
 * Inserted into the vagina after ejaculation, the Ferti Lily pushes semen
   towards the cervix (the opening of the uterus), cradling the sperm in the
   protective environment of the cervical mucus. This way, more sperm cells
   survive and more of them can swim up into the uterus. And the more sperm
   cells enter the uterus, the higher the chances that one of them will reach
   and penetrate the egg - thus increasing the odds of conception.

Conception Gel.

 * Apply during intercourse to smoothe movement and add pleasure.
