WHO IS IT FOR?

- ALL SKIN CONDITIONS (ESPECIALLY OILY)

- NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH NUT ALLERGIES

PRECLEANSE IS A FIRM FAVOURITE IN BEAUTY SKINCARE HQ! YOU WANT ULTRA CLEAN AND
HEALTHY SKIN, RIGHT? WELL LADIES...PRECLEANSE FROM DERMALOGICA WILL BE YOUR
FIRST STEP! WE FOLLOW THE DOUBLE CLEANSE REGIMEN, AND HAVE TO SAY, HAVE NOTICED
A HUGE CHANGE IN OUR SKINS HEALTH. 

Precleanse thoroughly melts layers of excess sebum (oil), sunscreen, waterproof
make-up, environmental pollutants and residual skin products that build-up
during the day. 

You'll first spread Precleanse across your face and neck, and follow with
dampened hands, over the face, which turns it into a milky emulsion. Its gentle
enough to use over eyes, and it's our secret weapon for taking off waterproof
mascara and heavy eye makeup. Trust us! You will become obsessed!

WHAT IS IT?

A lightweight Olive and Apricot Kernel-based cleansing oil, fortified with Kukui
Nut, Borage Seed and Rice Bran oils, that gently liquefies sebum and oil-based
debris from the skin?s surface. The hydrophilic (water-loving) formula enables
PreCleanse and oil-based debris to be readily rinsed away without leaving behind
any greasy residue. Follow with prescribed Dermalogica Cleanser for a thorough
double cleansing. Contains no artificial fragrance or colour.

HOW WILL I USE IT?

Remove eye and lip make up by dispensing Precleanse onto a damp cotton (Best

amount of Precleanse into your dry hands and spread between the palms. Starting
at the neck, spread Precleanse across your face by using light, upward circles
with your fingertips. Continue by circling your chin and cheeks, paying special
attention to areas of congestion. Use one fingertip on both sides of your
nostril, then circle around the side and top of your nose. Come between the your

The set includes:

 * Dermalogica Precleanse (30ml)

PreCleanse thoroughly melts away layers of excess sebum (oil), sunscreen,
waterproof make-up, pollutants and products that build up on skin, allowing your
cleanser to penetrate even further for professional results. The unique
rice-based powder formula of the Daily Microfoliant activates upon contact with
water, releasing Papain, Salicylic Acid and Rice Enzymes that micro-exfoliate
dead cells, instantly leaving skin smoother and brighter. Use these two products
together to reveal your skin’s healthiest glow and for a refreshing start to
your day.

Product details

Precleanse is a firm favourite in Beauty Skincare HQ! You want ultra clean and
healthy skin, right? Well Ladies...Precleanse from Dermalogica will be your
first step! We follow the double cleanse regimen, and have to say, have noticed
a huge change in our skins health. Precleanse thoroughly melts layers of excess
sebum (oil), sunscreen, waterproof make-up, environmental pollutants and
residual skin products that build-up during the day.  You'll first spread
Precleanse across your face and neck, and follow with dampened hands, over the
face, which turns it into a milky emulsion. Its gentle enough to use over eyes,
and it's our secret weapon for taking off waterproof mascara and heavy eye
makeup. Trust us! You will become obsessed!

What is it?

A lightweight Olive and Apricot Kernel-based cleansing oil, fortified with Kukui
Nut, Borage Seed and Rice Bran oils, that gently liquefies sebum and oil-based
debris from the skin?s surface. The hydrophilic (water-loving) formula enables
PreCleanse and oil-based debris to be readily rinsed away without leaving behind
any greasy residue. Follow with prescribed Dermalogica Cleanser for a thorough
double cleansing. Contains no artificial fragrance or colour.

How will I use it?

Remove eye and lip make up by dispensing Precleanse onto a damp cotton (Best
used with the Sponge Cloth
[%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/products/The-Sponge-Cloth.html]). Shake a generous
amount of Precleanse into your dry hands and spread between the palms. Starting
at the neck, spread Precleanse across your face by using light, upward circles
with your fingertips. Continue by circling your chin and cheeks, paying special
attention to areas of congestion. Use one fingertip on both sides of your
nostril, then circle around the side and top of your nose. Come between the your
eyebrows and continue circles over your forehead, making sure to include the
hairline. Wet your hands and massage over Precleanse to create a light, milky
emulsion. Commence second cleanse with your favourite Dermalogica Cleanser.

How it works:

A blend of rich oils melts through oil and oil-based debris that collects on
skin throughout the day. Vitamin E Oil, a rich antioxidant, helps improve skin
smoothness and softness. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride: is an emulsifying agent
that is activated by the addition of water to release the bonded oils from the
skin's surface.

WHO IS IT FOR?

Mature or prematurely-aging skin

WHAT IS IT?

Dermalogica convenient 2-in-1 cleanser and exfoliator!

A dual-action exfoliating cleanser containing Lactic Acid (5%) that smoothes,
retexturizes and delivers ultra-clean skin. Use of this Dermalogica cleanser
prepares skin for maximum penetration of Dermalogica AGE Smart®™ active
ingredients. Just like all Dermalogica products, it contains no artificial
fragrance or colour.

HOW WILL I USE IT?

Because of the expensive ingredients in this Dermalogica Cleanser, we really
advise you use Dermalogica PreCleanse
[%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/products/Precleanse.html] first, following the
Dermalogica Double cleanse advice. 

Following the application of PreCleanse, dispense Dermalogica Skin Resurfacing
Cleanser (1 pump) onto dampened hands and apply to damp face and throat morning
and evening, massaging with light, upward strokes for at least 30 seconds,
avoiding the eye area. Rinse thoroughly with warm water. Reduce to one use per
day if any sensitivity develops. Follow with Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF30. when
used in the morning.

BeautySkincare.ie Tip:

When starting out with Dermalogica's AGE Smart® Cleanser, we suggest you slowly
introduce this into your skincare regime. Start by using it 3 alternating nights
a week (lets say: Monday, Wednesday and Friday) for the first week or 2, and
then build it up to 4 nights, 5 nights etc. Not everyone will need to do this,
but if you find your skin is uncomfortable to start, slow it down, and introduce
it like this. It's an amazing product, see below how it works. 

HOW IT WORKS:

 * Lactic Acid dramatically smoothes skin while hydrating, brightening, and
   accelerating cell turnover.
 * Antioxidant Vitamin E improves skin softness.
 * Rose Flower Oil helps calm and soothe skin sensitivity.
 * Preps skin for maximum penetration of Dermalogica AGE Smart®™ treatment
   products.

Who is it For?

Skin with dark spots, in need of brightening.

Product Details:

Dark spots can also be known as sun spots, age spots or melasma. These are all a
form of hyperpigmentation of the skin, when an area of skin becomes darker than
the rest due to an excess production of melanin deposits and can be triggered by
many factors like UV rays, pollution, hormones, injuries etc. This serum targets
these areas and fades them over time leaving them brighter and your skin looking
luminous after use.

 * Evens skintone.
 * Smooths skin.
 * Brightens dark spots.

How will I use it?

 * Apply one pump in the morning after cleansing and toning.
 * Allow one minute for product absorption.

Daily Microfoliant [%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/daily-microfoliant/] before serums.
